<p><em>Minor late night rant&hellip;</em> 😑</p>
<p>I wish Steam would add an option to restrict who can send you friend requests. Something like an option so only friends of friends or people that you have recently played with are the only ones that can send you friend requests. And an option to block all the &ldquo;private 0 level&rdquo; profiles from adding you&hellip;</p>
<p>Anyway&hellip; I used to be semi-active in Steam discussions for games that I play and sometimes in off-topic section as well. I also post my fan arts on Steam on my profile. Aaand&hellip; I kinda hate it that now that I am becoming diet-famous I often get random requests from people I have never seen in my life. Also, I&rsquo;m pretty open about being <em>(gasp)</em> a woman, so maybe that plays a part too?..</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not too bad, but me being a somewhat paranoid and introverted person, I admit it&rsquo;s honestly kinda annoying. I even have a &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t accept random friend requests!&rdquo; message in big blue letters in my bio, but I guess some people just can&rsquo;t read or don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I just want to say, I am glad that people like my artworks. However, I am here just to share my art and love for these games I play. <strong>I don&rsquo;t want to be your friend!!!</strong> Don&rsquo;t take it personally.</p>

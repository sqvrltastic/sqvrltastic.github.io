Yeah, the learning curve can be a bit steep, especially if you want to learn (and I strongly recommend it for this use case) <abbr title="Static Site Generators">SSGs</abbr>, like HUGO. But I swear, it&rsquo;s <em>so</em> worth it! It&rsquo;s also a pretty fun and useful hobby&mldr;</p><p><em>Slight tangent here;</em> honestly, I think if I had to start over, I might have gone for 11ty or Astro because their intro tutorial is much, much better than HUGO&rsquo;s and that&rsquo;s honestly my main gripe with HUGO&mldr; HUGO&rsquo;s documentation fucking sucks and people on official forums are often really smug, grumpy and condescending assholes. <del>And if that makes you feel butthurt and defensive, well, maybe you are the issue.</del></p><p>But yeah, learning HUGO (and to be fair, I&rsquo;m still learning it, and I&rsquo;m considering learning Go sometime in the future as well) was sometimes like trying to decipher borderline esoteric manuscripts in foreign language. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, for the most part, now that I figured it out, I do enjoy HUGO and don&rsquo;t feel like switching. It&rsquo;s fast. And while that might not seem like a huge deal if your website had only 15 to 20 pages, us artists might have thousands of artworks and generating all those pages can take a while with SSGs written in other programming languages (for the record, HUGO is written in Go).</p><p>Also FYI, I decided to go with HUGO in the first place simply because it was, at one point, shilled a lot by a few Linux YouTubers I watched at the time.</p><p>/end of infodump</p><p>Anyway&mldr; I really wish that, when I discover a new artist, I can go on their own handcrafted website instead of Insta or Twitter, or, in rarer cases, Tumblr or <del>BS</del> (lol!!! LMAO!!!) sorry, BlueSky. Visiting a personal website feels like being a guest in someone&rsquo;s home.</p><p>Also, I would really want to build community with fellow artists <em>that I like</em> and exchange buttons, visit each other&rsquo;s websites and follow each other&rsquo;s web weaving progress, leave messages in guest books <del>(I&rsquo;m still planning to add on to my site I swear!!!)</del>, actually see new updates in RSS feeds etc&mldr; Just building a more human and more slow, calmer and ultimately more fulfilling and enriching web together!</p><p>Another point to make is that social media promotes shallow, unfulfilling interactions. Like just liking someone&rsquo;s work. And actually, you can add &ldquo;likes&rdquo; or &ldquo;kudos&rdquo; on your own site too if you want. But I honestly don&rsquo;t really like them. I would much rather contact people directly and express my appreciation of their work in the comments or DMs (or in guest books and emails).</p><p>I know some people are shy and worry that they might be &ldquo;cringy&rdquo;, in which case, <span class=text-uppercase><strong>stop!!! Really, stop being shy!!!</strong></span> It&rsquo;s not good for you! Just start small and just try to talk to strangers sometimes! It can be pretty fun and fulfilling!</p><p>Lastly, I already said it before, but if you want to actually own Musk, <strong>leave his platform</strong>, instead of doing your lazy retweeting slacktivism and virtue signaling nonsense.</p></main><footer><p>&copy; 2025 Sqvrltastic Art Archive | All rights reserved.</p><p>Powered by Hugo & GitHub Pages</p></footer><script src=/assets/js/theme-body.v1.js></script></body></html>

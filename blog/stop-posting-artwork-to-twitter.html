    <main> <h1 id="please-stop-posting-your-artwork-to-twitter">Please, stop posting your artwork to Twitter</h1>
<p>Yes, I know, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;X&rdquo; now. No, I don&rsquo;t care. I will be calling it Twitter in this blog post. &ldquo;Man, have you seen that tweet on X?&rdquo;, said literally nobody. <del>Also, why is it still called a &ldquo;tweet&rdquo;, if it&rsquo;s on X? Shouldn&rsquo;t it be called a xeet?..</del> I digress. Anyway&hellip; Here is why you should delete and uninstall Twitter like, right now&hellip;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start&hellip; <em>Twitter</em>. The infamous hellsite. No, muskrat did not ruin Twitter. It was always bad. Terrible even. The only good thing about Twitter is that it acts as a sort of containment board for annoying people. After all, making your own website is a great stupid people filter because obviously, it&rsquo;s much harder than just making an account on social media and spitting out your word vomit for everyone to see. Safe to say, if Twitter were to die tomorrow, I would not be mourning its passing. No, I would probably be celebrating.</p>
<p>Twitter&rsquo;s whole premise sucks. The low word count and it&rsquo;s overall spammy and shitposting nature lends itself perfectly to being a perfect platform for bullying, meaningless arguments and spreading misinformation. What it is not suitable for, is for hosting and showcasing artworks. Yet so many artists still keep posting exclusively to Twitter. Why? Why are you doing this to yourself and your work?</p>
<p>Twitter&rsquo;s layout and functionality is not suitable for showcasing art. The media tab is very bare-bones and I sure as hell am not going to scroll through your timeline filled with unfunny memes and dumb political takes just to find an occasional art piece. Furthermore, you have no ability to personalize your profile. Your colors, fonts and layouts are predetermined and are just like everybody else&rsquo;s on that platform.</p>
<p>Another super annoying thing is having to make an account just to view your content. Nope. Not doing that. Bye bye. This is not just a Twitter problem though, most social media platforms are forcing you to make an account or <em>download an app</em> just to view content now. Also, there is Instagram that doesn&rsquo;t even have full functionality on PC. Oh, and both Twitter and Instagram train their generative AI models on your posts, so there is that too.</p>
<p>You also don&rsquo;t have an easy way to back up and transfer your data. Like sure, you can request all of your data to be archived and download it, but you usually just get this massive, poorly structured .zip archive. And then you have to wait for 24 hours for it to be created and you can&rsquo;t easily transfer it to another platform. Meanwhile, my entire HUGO website is just a bunch of files inside folders that I can copy and upload at any time, anywhere. I can easily go from one host to another if I don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when you are at someone else&rsquo;s platform, you are at their current content moderation policy&rsquo;s mercy. You can get banned for whatever just or unjust reason or lose access to your account and your posts. Or, higher-ups may suddenly decide to change their ToS and deem your previously safe posts unsuitable for their platform from now on and delete all of them. Do you want your years of hard work to disappear in another Tumblr porn purge?</p>
<p>And sure, I do know that internet censorship is not just relegated to social media. Your hosting provider, your domain registrar or your CDN service might drop you, or your website might even get blocked by ISPs. The point is, while the internet is largely decentralized, it does have a few choke points so to say, but that&rsquo;s a topic for another time.</p>
<p>If you want to read more about it, here is a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/24/online-moderation-tech-stack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">good article</a> by the Washington Post (note: if a popup appears asking to sign up, you can try disabling the website&rsquo;s JavaScript with a browser extension like NoScript).</p>
<p>People like to argue that social media sites create echo-chambers, but often, I feel the opposite is actually the problem. People who are completely unrelated get grouped together which causes a lot of arguments and tension. The algorithm keeps pushing posts that often have nothing to do with art and are just there to make you angry and make you keep scrolling which is just not good for anybody and is not a productive way to spend your time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But everybody is on Twitter!&rdquo; No they&rsquo;re not. Not true at all. I&rsquo;m not and none of my friends are. It just seems that way because, as I mentioned, Twitter seems to be home for the most vocal and annoying <em>minority</em> of people. This belief that everybody is on Twitter is just keeping you and your friends trapped.</p>
<p>Not to mention that Twitter isn&rsquo;t even that good for discovering new artists. As far as I know, Twitter posts don&rsquo;t seem to get indexed by search engine crawlers. If you stay on Twitter just to get discovered for the fan art you draw, I feel that Reddit is a much better platform for that since it does not have algorithms and Reddit posts tend to show up a lot more in search engines. Of course, Reddit has a slew of problems of its own too&hellip;</p>
<p>I get that some people depend on marketing on social media like Twitter for their livelihood, but even then, at least try to only use it for those professional purposes and do have your own platform outside of Twitter. But, if you are just a hobby artist, please, make the jump, leave Twitter and hopefully more people will follow your footsteps.</p>
<p>I would never want to be friends with someone who has an active Twitter account. Everybody who is active on Twitter is a loser. Yes, everybody. <em>No exceptions</em>.</p>

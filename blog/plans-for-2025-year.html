engine crawler bots. Supposedly, it should be an automated process, but it
just doesn&rsquo;t seem to work for me. I had to manually submit my page to Google
for it to get it indexed, but it only worked with the landing page.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know&mldr; To be honest, I&rsquo;m at a loss of what causes it, but I suspect
that the issue might be with GitHub itself. I looked it up and apparently
other people seem to have similar issues with their websites hosted on GitHub
pages.</p><p>This is why I am thinking of eventually switching hosts and most likely buying
a custom domain in the near future. But it&rsquo;s not something that I&rsquo;m gonna do
straight away as I have to research more about it and compare all the options
first.</p><p>Also, if you had similar issues with search engines and found a solution, I&rsquo;d
appreciate it if you reach out to me and let me know what helped you&mldr;</p></main><footer><p>&copy; 2025 Sqvrltastic Art Archive</p><p>Powered by Hugo & GitHub Pages</p></footer><script src=/assets/js/theme-body.v1.js></script></body></html>

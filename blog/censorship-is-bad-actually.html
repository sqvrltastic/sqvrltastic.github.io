Essentially, here is what my argument boils down to&mldr;</p><p>Truth is, I actually do think that at least <em>some</em> art and/or porn is very much &ldquo;problematic&rdquo; or comes from &ldquo;bad&rdquo; people but, if you ban that, those bad things don&rsquo;t just magically disappear. Just because you banned, for example, porn with &ldquo;misogynistic&rdquo; elements in it doesn&rsquo;t mean that misogyny will disappear from real life. People already tried banning alcohol before, yet the ban did not stop people from drinking it in secret, nor did it get rid of the reason people resort to alcohol in the first place.</p><p>Art and/or porn is a reflection of reality and current societal norms and some of it is bound to be questionable and you are very much welcome to conduct <em>civilized</em> discussions about it! But censoring &ldquo;questionable&rdquo; content, <em>as long as it&rsquo;s legal</em>, is not an answer. See, you might think that a particular piece of media is &ldquo;obscene&rdquo; and morally bankrupt and has no artistic merit, therefore it should be banned and yet, others might have very good reasons to disagree with you. Who do you think you are to think that you are an ultimate, pure paragon of morality and good taste, and that your own biases won&rsquo;t influence your decisions?</p><p>No, not a single person or group of people can or should ever be the ultimate arbiter of morality and what is acceptable in the media, and especially not the government and large payment processors, who are known for their very blunt, nuclear, and all encompassing approach when it comes to censorship.</p><p>Remember, the slippery slope is very much a real phenomenon here, and the censorship will <em>never</em> just end at what you personally find &ldquo;yucky&rdquo; or &ldquo;weird&rdquo;. There was this one time when <a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-53319505 target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">an ice-cream brand in Russia was accused of spreading &ldquo;gay propaganda&rdquo;</a> because of rainbow packaging, for example. A farce, it&rsquo;s what it is. Lastly, remember the old saying, <strong>don&rsquo;t like, don&rsquo;t read</strong>.</p></main><div class=divider></div><footer><p>&copy; 2025 Sqvrltastic Art Archive</p><p>Powered by Hugo & GitHub Pages</p></footer><script>const toggle=document.getElementById("theme-toggle"),icon=document.getElementById("theme-icon"),html=document.documentElement,sunIcon="/images/icons/sun.png",moonIcon="/images/icons/moon.png";toggle.addEventListener("click",()=>{const t=html.getAttribute("data-theme"),e=t==="dark"?"light":"dark";html.setAttribute("data-theme",e),localStorage.setItem("theme",e),icon.src=e==="dark"?moonIcon:sunIcon,icon.alt=e==="dark"?"Dark theme ON":"Light theme ON"});const initialTheme=html.getAttribute("data-theme");icon.src=initialTheme==="dark"?moonIcon:sunIcon,icon.alt=initialTheme==="dark"?"Dark theme ON":"Light theme ON"</script></body></html>

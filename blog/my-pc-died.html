How and why did this happen? I have no fucking idea.</p><p>I have an ASUS board and 7800X3D CPU and Corsair RAM that is on the approved RAM list. I did run EXPO with a stock preset of 6000MT/s, and a very minimal undervolt of the CPU, but other than that, everything was stock. Never dabbled in any sort of advanced overclocking. Never had any issues.</p><p>It all started one day when my PC decided to randomly reboot. No warning, no BSOD, just straight to reboot. I wasn&rsquo;t even doing anything demanding at the time, merely being in Discord call. I checked my temps, checked voltage, all stable, no overheating, nothing at all.</p><p>Then I went to check the event viewer which showed a critical code 41 error. I didn&rsquo;t like that. I got a hunch that it might be my worst case scenario, it being hardware failure, especially since I don&rsquo;t recall installing any new updates or software. Still, I decided not to panic <em>just yet</em>, and wait to see if it happens again.</p><p>Two days go, and nothing. I almost thought that it was indeed nothing, probably some Windows glitch or something, and then it happened <em>again</em>, out of nowhere. I was drawing in Photoshop and luckily I did save my work just in time (it&rsquo;s another fan art of Kerillian!!!), when my PC decided to reboot itself again.</p><p>And then the reboots started happening all the time, to the point that my PC has become unusable. I managed to back up my files and settings, right before my PC decided to completely kick the bucket and refused to even POST anymore. Now when I turn it on, I just get a perpetual yellow DRAM LED light indicating that there is an issue with RAM and I get the PC fans spinning.</p><p>Now here I am stuck troubleshooting it and switching parts around. Not gonna lie, I did freak out and cried like a bitch a few times. Can&rsquo;t help myself really. My PC is everything to me: I draw, I code, I work on it, I <strong>love</strong> to play games and I chat with my long distance friends on it&mldr; Inb4 &ldquo;touch grass loser&rdquo; <span class=text-uppercase>how about go fuck yourself you smartass moron. <strong>Fuck you.</strong></span></p><p>P.S. I <em>really</em> hope I can get it fixed ASAP&mldr; Working on it. I am a pretty techie person myself; I chose the parts and I built my current PC myself, but I&rsquo;m still at a loss&mldr;</p></main><footer><p>&copy; 2025 Sqvrltastic Art Archive</p><a class=rss-btn href=/rss.xml target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src=/images/icon-rss.avif alt="RSS feed icon">

I was itching to write something lately (and I&rsquo;ll probably update this site a bit later as well) and this is a perfect way to warm up my writing muscles. Warning for brutal honesty ahead.</p><p><i>Also, I fixed a few of the author&rsquo;s typos and grammatical errors in the questions themselves here and there, just FYI.</i></p><p>Anyway&mldr;</p><p><b>1. Please introduce yourself.</b></p><p>I&rsquo;m sqvrltastic, a young woman in my mid 20s from Montenegro. I am an artist and an indie web enthusiast. I game and watch old anime in my spare time.</p><p><b>2. How long have you been making websites?</b></p><p>I think I made my first website waaay back in the late 2000/early 2010 era. It was a fan site for an anime Tokyo Mew Mew that I hand coded in Microsoft Frontpage. I think I hosted it at narod.ru at first, but when they removed the HTML editor I moved to uCoz. I don&rsquo;t remember what happened, but eventually I deleted it.</p><p>However, that was a long time ago and I abandoned coding after a while and got busy with other things. However, around a year ago I decided to actually learn website development <em>for real</em> this time and I spent my free time pretty much learning most things from scratch, since a lot of web dev practices changed a lot since the late 2000s.</p><p><b>3. And what got you into the hobby?</b></p><p>I initially decided to create my first website at around 10 years old because I got inspired by this beautiful website called <a href=https://rainbow-knights.narod.ru/main01.htm target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Рыцари Радуги — фан сайт (Rainbow Knight fan site</a>, hosted on narod.ru. It&rsquo;s dedicated to a Russian comic I loved at that time. I still think fondly of it, despite it being borderline lost media. <em>I remember.</em> Also, I loved the <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20240904105245/https://yula-jurnal.narod.ru/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Yula</em> fan site</a> (archived copy) and the <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106105145/https://www.yula-best.ru/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">official <em>Yula</em> magazine page</a> (archived copy). There are some other anime related websites that I remember, I even remember the visuals, but I don&rsquo;t remember what they were called, unfortunately.</p><p>I remember this one site in particular that had some shoujo anime graphics, specifically a large banner at the top, a small chatbox/guestbook on the right side, and I think the content was in the center. I think the overall color palette was on the warmer side&mldr; I remember chatting with the webmistress and I remember she has a section on her site where you could send your own site for review and critique and it would then be featured there, and I sent mine and got some good feedback. 🙂 Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t remember the site&rsquo;s name.</p><p>And I got into the hobby again because I became disillusioned with the state of the modern internet and social media. Also, I needed a place to serve as a safe haven for my art, and none of the social media really met my criteria anymore.</p><p><b>4. What kind of website are you most interested in?</b></p><p>I would love it if the fanartists and fic writers that I follow on social media made a website for their works. Doesn&rsquo;t have to be anything fancy, in fact I prefer designs that are straightforward and don&rsquo;t get in the way. Just something that has an RSS fedd so I can follow them outside of their shitty walled garden platforms like Tumblr or Twitter.</p><p><b>5. What&rsquo;s your workflow? Do you plan your websites out thoroughly or do you come up with the design as you go along?</b></p><p>I start by deciding what will be the core purpose of my site, and/or what kind of content I want to host on it. Then, I decide how to organize and structure said content and create design that fits.</p><p><b>6. Please link to your biggest inspirations.</b></p><p>I don&rsquo;t have any yet, for better or worse. I am very particular about what I like and what I am trying to achieve with my website and I have pretty high standards for myself and others. There are some websites on the indie web where I enjoy a lot of aspects of them, but there is always some part of them that I would do differently and in my opinion, &ldquo;better&rdquo;. I guess it&rsquo;s the great thing about the personal web — you can always do your own thing the way you like it, irrespective of what is trendy at the moment.</p><p><b>7. What&rsquo;s your favorite part about making websites?</b></p><p>Honestly, I&rsquo;m not sure. I guess I really like organizing things and cleaning up my code. It&rsquo;s probably not something that a lot of people that casually browse my site notice, but I am very meticulous about it.</p><p><b>8. And the thing you struggle with the most?</b></p><p>Good design lol. Or rather, a <em>good</em> maximalist, elaborate design that looks both pretty <em>and</em> doesn&rsquo;t compromise the usability of the site and doesn&rsquo;t detract from the main content of the site. I think most webmasters at places like Neocities fail at both, if I&rsquo;m being honest. That&rsquo;s the main reason I stick with a somewhat bland, <em>true minimalist</em> design. I would like to design my own fancy graphics for my site, maybe one day&mldr;</p><p><b>9. Do you keep the same layout on all of your pages? Or do you use different ones?</b></p><p>Same layout on the entire site. I despise it when I click on a link and the whole layout changes, it feels really disorienting, like I accidentally landed on a whole different website. They can be done well, but most of the time they are done extremely poorly IMO.</p><p><b>10. How confident are you with CSS?</b></p><p>Pretty confident. I can do most things with CSS and HTML5 where others lean on JavaScript as a crutch.</p><p><b>11. Do you know how to correctly use <code>&lt;dl></code> ?</b></p><p>I had to google it. Never used it before.</p><p><b>12. What is your favorite HTML element?</b></p><p>Kind of a silly question. Favorite HTML element? Do you want me to sign your friendship book too, maybe?.. <del>Actually, it&rsquo;s <code>&lt;<del>details</del>></code></del>.</p><p><b>13. If you&rsquo;re making a new web page from scratch, what is the first thing you do?</b></p><p>Check >>5.</p><p><b>14. Do you know JavaScript?</b></p><p>A bit.</p><p><b>15. How about PHP?</b></p><p>I don&rsquo;t know it, and I&rsquo;d rather avoid it.</p><p><b>16. Does your website have a theme that you stick to?</b></p><p>Well, <em>yeah</em>.</p><p><b>17. Are you more focused on content or design?</b></p><p>Content 100%. The job of the design is to frame it well and <em>get out of the way</em>, IMO.</p><p><b>18. Do you own a domain name? If not, would you ever want to?</b></p><p>Yes! I love my domain name. 💖</p><p><b>19. What do you think of nostalgia-focused or &ldquo;retro&rdquo; websites?</b></p><p>Hoo boy&mldr; Here it comes. Well, if I&rsquo;m being <em>brutally honest</em>, I think most of them are pretty terrible, to put it mildly. I get that a lot of Neocities users are kids, but still&mldr; Bunch of shit code filled with self-absorbed navel-gazers with no style or substance. I truly wish the whole 90s Neocities LARP trend just fucking dies already. Also, a lot of actual web 1.0 sites were, in fact, pretty well-designed for the time and had quality content on them.</p><p><b>20. Is your HTML valid? Do you even check?</b></p><p>I don&rsquo;t go crazy over it.</p><p><b>21. What is your opinion on buttons and banners?</b></p><p>I love the concept of them, but I think that 88x31 is just too small. We need a bigger standard.</p><p><b>22. What do you think of button walls in particular?</b></p><p>Not a fan. I prefer to write a short description of a site, as well as organize it in a grid or table. Just dumping a bunch of eye bleeding buttons together just seems trashy and low effort.</p><p><b>23. If you started over again, would you make something similar or completely different?</b></p><p>Similar. I&rsquo;m mostly satisfied with my site.</p><p><b>24. Are you envious of other people&rsquo;s websites?</b></p><p>Not at all lol. I might come off as immodest by saying this, but I genuinely believe that I&rsquo;m a better coder than 99% of the indie web sphere and typical SEO slop sites.</p><p><b>25. What text editor do you use?</b></p><p>Visual Studio Code</p><p><b>26. Why do you use that one?</b></p><p>Because it&rsquo;s simple and it just works.</p><p><b>27. Do you host your image files on your web server, or on another host?</b></p><p>I host it on the same server.</p><p><b>28. This might not be relevant to you, but what&rsquo;s your opinion on the Neocities vs. Nekoweb debate?</b></p><p>Same shit really. I suppose the name &ldquo;Neocities&rdquo; is slightly less stupid than &ldquo;Nekoweb&rdquo;.</p><p><b>29. How much server space would you estimate your main website takes up?</b></p><p>My whole /public/ folder, a.k.a. ready-to-upload website files that I generate with HUGO, along with all the images, is 26.6MB in total.</p><p><b>30. Do you keep local backups of your files?</b></p><p><del>Man, you know the situation with the indie web devs is dire when you need to ask such a question lol.</del></p><p><b>31. Do you prefer simple or highly visual websites?</b></p><p>I prefer design that enhances, or at least, doesn&rsquo;t get in the way of me enjoying the website&rsquo;s <em>content</em>.</p><p><b>32. Do you stick to certain colors? Do you do that on purpose, or is it your subconscious?</b></p><p>No. At least, not intentionally. However, all of my websites are some variation of white, gray and black because those are neutral colors that work with everything.</p><p><b>33. Have you ever thought about quitting? Why?</b></p><p>No. Not at all. I have my comfy corner here away from all the noise <del>and idiots with custom Snoo avatars</del>, why would I ever go back to normie social media? I guess I still use Reddit to engage with fandoms and hopefully drive the traffic here, so hopefully more people discover the joy of making a personal website.</p><p><b>34. Do you have many webmaster friends, or is it a solitary hobby?</b></p><p>Not yet, unfortunately. As you might have noticed, I am pretty argumentative and hold a lot of &ldquo;unpopular&rdquo; opinions regarding the state of the &ldquo;Indie Web&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m kind of a contrarian in general. I hate giving empty platitudes and I criticize things because I <em>care</em>. I would love to make more <em>female</em> friends, someday, hopefully. I admit that I haven&rsquo;t really reached out to anyone yet either. Just lazy I suppose.</p><p><b>35. Do people in your real life know about your website?</b></p><p>Yeah. They like it.</p><p><b>36. Do you update your website very often? How often is &ldquo;very often&rdquo;?</b></p><p>Not too often. Maybe once a month at best, or once every few months.</p><p><b>37. And the overall design, do you change that much? Why or why not?</b></p><p>Not that often. Only when I have a very specific idea in mind, or my eye for good design improves.</p><p><b>38. Is your website more you-focused, hobby-focused, or outside world-focused?</b></p><p>Hobby-focused.</p><p><b>39. Do you do web design professionally?</b></p><p>Occasionally; usually as a one-off freelance side-gig.</p><p><b>40. If not, would you like to? And if you&rsquo;re comfortable answering, what do you do for work?</b></p><p>I prefer to keep my work life private.</p><p><b>41. Do you communicate with people by email very much?</b></p><p>Not too often, but I do like emails.</p><p><b>42. Some people reject social media and use websites as a replacement. Do you keep social media outside of your website?</b></p><p>I still use Reddit. Mostly to just post my art and check other&rsquo;s art. I browse Tumblr anonymously with Tumlook for fanart, but I dislike the site overall. That&rsquo;s mostly it.</p><p><b>43. How about instant messengers? Do you use a mainstream one like Discord or Telegram? Or something like Matrix? Do you avoid them?</b></p><p>Discord for friends and Telegram for family and older people.</p><p><b>44. Do you listen to music while you work on websites? If so, what kinds of artists?</b></p><p>Sometimes. Often though, I like to work in silence.</p><p><b>45. Do you keep everything you make on one website, or do you have more than one?</b></p><p>I have a separate website focused on cooking and recipes.</p><p><b>46. On a similar note, do you keep to one topic on your site, or many?</b></p><p>My art is mostly video game fan arts, with occasional shitposty OC content. As for blog, it&rsquo;s really anything I feel like writing at the time.</p><p><b>47. Do you present your real self, or at least try? Or do you construct a persona on purpose?</b></p><p>&mldr; Next question.</p><p><b>48. Have you ever made a good friend thanks to your website?</b></p><p>Haven&rsquo;t yet. See >>34</p><p><b>49. Are you happy with the way HTML and CSS currently work?</b></p><p>I don&rsquo;t have any complaints, aside that I still sometimes forget how to center a div, vertically</p><p><b>50. What are practices that you think people should avoid?</b></p><p>Too much to list really.</p><p><b>51. What about underutilized practices, or things you think people should do more?</b></p><p>I think both this and the previous question would require a separate blogpost to fully answer.</p><p><b>52. Do you use a lot of semantic HTML? Or are you guilty of generic structure?</b></p><p>Yes! I love semantic HTML.</p><p><b>53. Do you consider different browsers?</b></p><p>I use Firefox primarily, but I do check my stuff on Edge (Chromium based). I avoid using features that don&rsquo;t have wide support.</p><p><b>54. Speaking of, what&rsquo;s your preferred browser? Convince your readers why they should use it.</b></p><p>Good ol&rsquo; Firefox. Why should you use it? Well for starters, it&rsquo;s probably the only mainstream noncommercial open-source browser. You can also disable telemetry for good and install Ublock origin to watch YouTube without ads.</p><p><b>55. And what OS are you on?</b></p><p>Windows 11, for better or worse.</p><p><b>56. Do you have a strong opinion on that, or do you just happen to use it?</b></p><p>I have an X270 Thinkpad with Linux Mint installed on it. It&rsquo;s a good machine, but I use my PC for more than just internet browsing, you know.</p><p><b>57. Are your websites mobile-friendly?</b></p><p>Yes.</p><p><b>58. What are your thoughts on autoplay?</b></p><p>If you do it, I hope your motherboard dies and your porn folder gets wiped. Delete your site and never do web dev again.</p><p><b>59. What are your thoughts on webrings? Are you in any?</b></p><p>Interesting in theory, most fail in practice. Most fan listings and webrings I&rsquo;ve seen are either dead or broken, or they don&rsquo;t really have any curation and just accept whoever applies, leading to them being filled with low quality sites. Also, I think I prefer web directories. Maybe I&rsquo;ll start my own one day.</p><p><b>60. Do you have any web shrines? What do you like to see on that sort of page?</b></p><p>No. Not really my thing.</p><p><b>61. Are your websites &ldquo;cliché&rdquo;, in your opinion?</b></p><p>I guess my design is a bit too plain, but it works.</p><p><b>62. What is your ideal website? Are you striving for that, or for something else?</b></p><p>A website that&rsquo;s focused on good quality content and with a design that&rsquo;s distinct yet elegant and not overwhelming. I do try to improve my site when I feel that <em>it&rsquo;s time</em> and my skills have grown enough to fulfill my new vision.</p><p><b>63. Are you an artist? Do you draw or design your own assets?</b></p><p>I am, as you can see. But my website doesn&rsquo;t utilize any graphics yet.</p><p><b>64. What are your favorite resource sites?</b></p><p>MDN and w3schools for checking documentation.</p><p><b>65. Is there a habit you just can&rsquo;t get away from no matter how hard you try?</b></p><p>Not really.</p><p><b>66. What&rsquo;s your biggest advice for a new webmaster?</b></p><p>Have something to say. Don&rsquo;t just make a worthless nostalgiashit website because it&rsquo;s trendy. Follow the current web dev best practices and don&rsquo;t use obsolete techniques. Don&rsquo;t copy and paste code that you do not understand. Less is more. <strong>Remember to touch grass.</strong></p><p><b>67. Do you keep all your styling in CSS? Or do you hard-code some?</b></p><p>Everything in an external stylesheet.</p><p><b>68. What do you think of frameset layouts?</b></p><p>Please don&rsquo;t.</p><p><b>69. How about table-based layouts?</b></p><p>This brings me back to my years of making a Tokyo Mew Mew fan site on narod.ru&mldr; Unless your goal is to mimic an actual 90s site, <em>don&rsquo;t</em>.</p><p><b>70. Do you subscribe to the ideas of &ldquo;one-column&rdquo;, &ldquo;two-column&rdquo; and &ldquo;three-column&rdquo; layouts? Do you use any of these?</b></p><p>I don&rsquo;t really think about layouts in that way to be honest. I guess I mostly use the single column, centered layout.</p><p><b>71. Do you spend longer on HTML or CSS?</b></p><p>I go back and forth.</p><p><b>72. Have you ever made a page with no CSS? It&rsquo;s useful for your thoughts.</b></p><p>No. I haven&rsquo;t really felt the need to.</p><p><b>73. Do you ever find yourself making layouts with nothing to put on them? Or do you only make layouts when the need arises?</b></p><p>I&rsquo;m not really one to come up with elaborate layouts &ldquo;naturally&rdquo;, so no.</p><p><b>74. Would you consider yourself a beginner? Or advanced? Somewhere in the middle?</b></p><p>I&rsquo;d say advanced with HTML and CSS, but beginner with JavaScript (and Go for HUGO).</p><p><b>75. Do you have a habit of looking at the source code of websites you visit?</b></p><p>I sometimes use the &ldquo;Inspect element&rdquo; tool in Firefox, but other than that no, not really.</p><p><b>76. How did <em>you</em> learn how to make websites?</b></p><p>Well, I watched some tutorials&mldr; But most importantly, I would actually try to create things that I had in mind and based on what I struggled with, I would do further research.</p><p><b>77. Do you ever force elements to do things they&rsquo;re not supposed to?</b></p><p>No, because it&rsquo;s bad for accessibility.</p><p><b>78. Thoughts on floating elements?</b></p><p>I don&rsquo;t use them and don&rsquo;t really have much to say.</p><p><b>79. When you&rsquo;re sizing stuff, what do you use first? Do you use px, em, %, or something else?</b></p><p>I use rem for most things, and % or vh or vw when I need them. I almost never use px.</p><p><b>80. Do you have a favorite font?</b></p><p>I would say Helvetica, but that joke stopped being funny in the 2000s. I do genuinely like it though. Other than that, Open Sans is nice I guess (the font on this site). Also, I recently used Montserrat for a project of mine and liked that one too. I like a lot of monospace fonts as well, Consolas for example. I think they are easy to read, I hate Arial.</p><p><b>81. Would you run a website with another person? How would that work?</b></p><p>I don&rsquo;t see the point.</p><p><b>82. Do you surf the Web to find new personal websites very often?</b></p><p>Occasionally.</p><p><b>83. Do you bookmark other people&rsquo;s websites? How would you feel knowing someone else bookmarked yours?</b></p><p>Yes, I do bookmark sites that I like. I also meticulously organize my bookmarks and back them up every once in a while. I would be honored if someone bookmarked my site.</p><p><b>84. What do you want people to be most impressed with when they see your website?</b></p><p>I hope they like my art. I know most people don&rsquo;t care for quality of code, unless something doesn&rsquo;t work, but I hope that people like how clean and well organized my code is. I am always striving to improve with both my art and coding skills.</p><p><b>85. Are you interested in technology outside of websites? Do you collect?</b></p><p>I&rsquo;ve chosen parts and built a PC for myself to work and game on.</p><p><b>86. How often and for how long are you online?</b></p><p>I spent a lot of time in front of my computer working and have Discord in the background, but I&rsquo;m not in any of the large servers and I don&rsquo;t really &ldquo;browse&rdquo; the web all that much.</p><p><b>87. When it comes to your website, who is your target audience?</b></p><p>People who enjoy the same things I like, obviously.</p><p><b>88. Have you ever been interested in XHTML?</b></p><p>I haven&rsquo;t heard it mentioned in a while. No, not really.</p><p><b>89. Do you program in general? Have you ever written a program for use with or on your website, not counting simple JavaScript?</b></p><p>I wrote hello world in Python once. Jokes aside, no, I don&rsquo;t code aside from my website. I&rsquo;d love to learn more about GO and JavaScript.</p><p><b>90. Speaking of programs that help you make websites, what do you think of static site generators (SSGs)? Have you ever used one?</b></p><p>I use HUGO and aside from a steep learning curve, I like it. I&rsquo;d say one minor downside is that it&rsquo;s a bit opinionated and kinda forces you into a blog format by default, but you can &ldquo;tame it&rdquo;, so to say. Nonetheless, I think any SSG is an invaluable tool and you should absolutely learn one if you want to make something like an art website or a blog.</p><p><b>91. Do you keep a hitcounter? Why or why not?</b></p><p>No, because it&rsquo;s bloat.</p><p><b>92. Do you frequent forums? Which ones?</b></p><p>Yes and I prefer the forum format to social media. I mostly browse forums related to my interests.</p><p><b>93. Do you write your page content directly into the editor, or do you prepare it elsewhere, like a text document or a Word document?</b></p><p>I do everything in VSCode.</p><p><b>94. Do you think you appear cool to others? A more accurate answer now: do other people ever say you&rsquo;re cool?</b></p><p>I don&rsquo;t think that I have that level of notoriety to be considered this or that yet.</p><p><b>95. Are you embarrassed of your old work? Have you ever deleted everything out of shame?</b></p><p>I think my old work is, well, beginner-y, like yes it&rsquo;s bad, but I also recognize that it was a necessary stepping stone and I look at it with some sense of fondness.</p><p><b>96. Would you close down your website if you couldn&rsquo;t update it, or would you leave an archive?</b></p><p>I&rsquo;d leave an archive ofc.</p><p><b>97. Do you reveal a lot about yourself on your website? Or are you more secretive?</b></p><p>I&rsquo;m very secretive.</p><p><b>98. Are you willing to reveal who your best online friend is, and/or if they have a website?</b></p><p>Nuh uh.</p><p><b>99. And do you optimize the images on your website?</b></p><p>Of course.</p><p><b>100. We&rsquo;re out of time! How do you feel after answering 100 questions? Other than exhausted.</b></p><p>I kinda liked it. It&rsquo;s been fun. I love talking about my interests. Formatting this thing has been a bit of pain, though.</p><p>/end</p></main><footer><p>&copy; 2025 Sqvrltastic Art Archive</p><p>Powered by Hugo & GitHub Pages</p></footer><script src=/assets/js/theme-body.v1.js></script></body></html>

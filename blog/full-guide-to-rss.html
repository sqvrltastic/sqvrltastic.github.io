<h2>What is RSS?</h2>
<p>
  From
  <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >Wikipedia:</a
  >
</p>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">
  <i>
    "RSS (which stands for "Really Simple Syndication") is a web feed that
    allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a
    standardized, computer-readable format."
  </i>
</blockquote>
<p>
  In layman terms, basically, RSS is a website's news feed that is standardized
  and which makes it possible for you to "subscribe" to your favorite website's
  news feed without actually creating an account there or signing up with your
  email for a newsletter or anything like that.
</p>
<p>
  On its own, RSS feed appears as a file in an XML format with a weird looking
  code inside that looks similar to HTML. You will need an RSS feed reader
  program to actually convert that code to a human-readable feed.
</p>
<p>
  There are <em>a lot</em> of RSS readers out there, both for PC and mobile,
  personally I use
  <a
    href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9p71fc94lrh8?hl=en-us&gl=US"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >"Fluent Reader"</a
  >
  on my Windows PC; you can get it from Microsoft Store. It's completely free
  and the code is open source.
</p>
<hr />
<h2>Why use RSS?</h2>
<p>
  Because social media feeds suck. You always get irrelevant, garbage posts, ads
  and you often don't even see the posts from people that you follow because of
  the algorithm. Not to mention that, often you can get distracted and you have
  to manually check each website individually. With RSS, you have all of your
  subscriptions in one place.
</p>
<p>
  You can subscribe to news sites, blogs, personal websites (if they have an RSS
  feed implemented) and also Tumblr blogs, subreddits, AO3, Bluesky profile
  feeds and even YouTube channels and many more! Though, take note that not
  every website takes its RSS feed seriously (shame!) and some of them are a bit
  poorly implemented.
</p>
<p>
  Also, RSS is much better in terms of privacy and security because you don't
  need to give anyone your data, like in the case of signing up to an email
  newsletter with your email.
</p>
<hr />
<h2>For users: How to use RSS</h2>
<p>
  As I said already, you will need an RSS feed reader program. On PC, you can
  use Fluent Reader like I do, or choose whichever one you like the most. They
  are mostly similar.
</p>
<p>
  I don't have recommendations for mobile apps since I don't really like
  scrolling on my phone all that much, but you can just search for "RSS reader"
  in whichever app store you have installed on your phone. Also, there is the
  <a href="https://f-droid.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >F-Droid</a
  >
  app store that has only
  <abbr title="free open source software">FOSS</abbr> apps there, meaning, those
  are usually apps that don't track you and don't show you ads or beg you to buy
  in-app purchases. I personally use it and can fully recommend it.
</p>
<p>
  First, go to the website you want to subscribe to. Look for the RSS logo that
  usually looks like a Wi-Fi symbol over an orange background (<img
    src="../images/rss.svg"
    alt=""
    width="15px"
    height="15px"
  />). Click on it; it should take you to the website's RSS feed. Simply copy
  the URL, launch your RSS feed reader, look for a button that says something
  along the lines of "add new source" and paste it there.
</p>
<p>
  If you can't find the RSS icon, don't fret. Try looking for an RSS feed by
  accessing it directly through your browser's address bar. Usually, the
  website's RSS feed is located at https://www.website.com/rss.xml, or at
  https://www.website.com/index.xml, or at https://www.website.com/rss, but it
  can vary. As an example, this website's RSS is located
  <a href="../rss.xml">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Some social media have a hidden RSS feed that you can access; some examples:
</p>
<p><strong>Tumblr:</strong> https://<i>username</i>.tumblr.com/rss</p>
<p><strong>Bluesky:</strong> https://bsky.app/profile/<i>username</i>/rss</p>
<p>
  <strong>Reddit:</strong> https://www.reddit.com/r/<em>subredditname</em>.rss
  or https://www.reddit.com/u/<em>username</em>.rss
</p>
<p>
  <strong>YouTube:</strong> Requires a bit of code digging, unfortunately. On
  PC:
</p>
<details>
  <summary>(show steps)</summary>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the YouTube channel in your browser.</li>
    <li>Right-click "view page source".</li>
    <li>Press Ctrl + F on your keyboard.</li>
    <li>Search for "browse_id" (without the quotation marks).</li>
    <li>
      You should find a part of the code that looks like this:
      <code>{"key":"browse_id","value":"<i>UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw</i>"}</code
      >, copy the string of random letters and numbers that is inside the
      "value" field, that is the channel's ID.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create a working URL to YouTube's channel RSS feed by replacing the
      "CHANNELID" part inside this URL template:
      https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=<i>CHANNELID</i>
      with the ID you just copied.
    </li>
  </ol>
</details>
<p>
  Alternatively, on Android, just use
  <a
    href="https://f-droid.org/packages/InfinityLoop1309.NewPipeEnhanced/"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >PipePipe</a
  >
  (my current fav), NewPipe or whatever other software fork there is.
</p>
<p>
  Feel free to look up online if a website has an RSS feed. A lot of them do,
  but they can be hidden.
</p>
<hr />
<h2>For developers: How to add an RSS feed to your website</h2>
<p>
  Now that I have hopefully convinced you of how great RSS is, here is a
  tutorial on how to actually implement it and add it to your website.
</p>
<p>
  Some website builders or <abbr title="static site generators">SSGs</abbr>,
  like for example HUGO which I use, have an option to auto generate RSS feeds,
  but I personally prefer not to use it and instead I prefer to manually write
  updates to my RSS feed, at least for this website. That way I feel I have more
  control.
</p>
<p>
  First, create a <strong>rss.xml</strong> file in the root directly of your
  website (meaning,
  <em>the top-most folder where all of your website's content resides</em>).
  Then, copy and paste the code below. Keep the overall structure and replace
  the content of each field with your own where applicable.
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Base of your RSS feed (show code)</summary>
  <pre><code><span class="text-colored">&#x3C;?xml version=&#x22;1.0&#x22; encoding=&#x22;UTF-8&#x22;?&#x3E;

<p>
  Next, you will want to add individual items or entries to your RSS feed. Below
  are code snippets that you can copy and paste.
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Basic feed item without any links (show code)</summary>
  <p>
    <i>
      I use this one when I just want to notify my subscribers of some small
      general update, for example about improving some parts of a site's
      functionality. It doesn't link to any larger page. Think of it as a log
      entry.
    </i>
  </p>

  <pre><code><span class="text-colored">&#x3C;item&#x3E;
    &#x3C;title&#x3E;</span><i>Title of your post</i><span class="text-colored">&#x3C;/title&#x3E;

        <i>Description of your post</i>

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Feed item that links to a full blog post (show code)</summary>
  <p>
    <i>
      This is probably the most common way people structure RSS items. This
      method is most suitable for when you have, for example, a recipe or a blog
      post that is mostly text based.
    </i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>
      Basically what it does is, it displays a title and a description (which
      acts as a preview to your full post) and when you click on "view full" in
      your RSS reader, it should switch to the blog post itself.

&#x3C;/item&#x3E;</span></code></pre>
</details>
<p>Some further explanation of each field:</p>
<p>
  <code>&lt;ttl&gt;</code> - "time to live"; tells your RSS reader how often to
  refresh the page. Time is set in minutes. Putting 1440 as value means that
  your RSS feed refreshes once a day, which is enough if you don't update your
  website all that often.
</p>
<p>
  <code>&lt;webMaster&gt;</code> - <em>optional</em>; your email for contact.
</p>
<p>
  <code>&lt;lastBuildDate&gt;</code> - timestamp that shows the last time the
  RSS feed was updated, in RFC2822 format. You can generate an RFC 2822
  timestamp on sites like the
  <a
    href="https://timestampgenerator.com/"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >UNIX timestamp generator</a
  >. It looks something like this when generated: Sat, 28 Dec 2024 16:26:14
  +0000.
</p>
<p>
  <code>&lt;pubDate&gt;</code> - timestamp that shows when the individual item
  was published, in RFC2822 format. Similar to
  <code>&lt;lastBuildDate&gt;</code>.
</p>
<p>
  <code>&lt;guid&gt;</code> - (from
  <a
    href="https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification#ltguidgtSubelementOfLtitemgt"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >rssboard.org</a
  >):
</p>
<blockquote
  cite="https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification#ltguidgtSubelementOfLtitemgt"
>
  <i>
    "<code>&lt;guid&gt;</code> is an optional sub-element of
    <code>&lt;item&gt;</code>. <strong>guid</strong> stands for <b>g</b>lobally
    <b>u</b>nique <b>id</b>entifier. It's a string that uniquely identifies the
    item. When present, an aggregator may choose to use this string to determine
    if an item is new."
  </i>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Usually, its content is the same as the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag. Also,
  keep in mind that
  <strong>you have to use absolute (full path) and not relative links!</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <code>&lt;enclosure&gt;</code> - <i>supposedly optional</i>, according to
  rssboard.org; a sub element of <code>&lt;item&gt;</code> that allows for
  embedding media; in my case, images.
</p>
<p>
  I did some tests and found out that on some RSS readers, using only the
  <code>&lt;enclosure&gt;</code> element is not enough and it doesn't embed the
  image, but on others it does. It seems a bit inconsistent. That is why I
  always use the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag inside the
  <code>&lt;description&gt;</code> element because I found that to be the most
  foolproof way to add images to RSS items, but I usually prefer to add
  <code>&lt;enclosure&gt;</code> element as well because it doesn't hurt I
  suppose.
</p>
<details>
  <summary>
    Some more info about the <code>&lt;enclosure&gt;</code> element...
  </summary>
  <p>
    It has three attributes: <code>url</code>, <code>length</code> and
    <code>type</code>. <code>url</code> is a link that points to your media
    file's location, <code>length</code> is the size of the file in bytes and
    <code>type</code> specifies the media type (<abbr
      title="Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"
      >MIME</abbr
    >
    type).
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that, while MIME type and file format are not exactly the same thing,
    in practice they often closely align. For example, if you have a .jpg image,
    the MIME type would be "image/<i>jpeg</i>".
  </p>
  <p>
    To get the <code>length</code> of a file (in my case, image), go to a folder
    where the image is located, open a bash terminal <em>in that folder</em> and
    enter a command: <code>stat --format=%s <i>your-image-name.jpg</i></code
    >. Copy the string of numbers you've got.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since I'm on Windows I use Git Bash and I will assume that you know at least
    remotely how to use it. There are other ways to do this, but I found this
    one to be the simplest one.
  </p>
</details>
<p>
  Now, hard part is over, now you just need to combine the two and fill your RSS
  feed with posts... Below is an example of how that might look like.

  <strong>Tip about favicons:</strong> Some RSS readers seem to completely
  ignore favicons, while some don't, it's a bit inconsistent. Although, after
  some testing, I found that the most sure way to have an RSS reader actually
  recognize and fetch your website's favicon is <em>to make sure</em> it's
  located in the root directory of your website and that it's named something
  like "favicon.ico".
</p>
<p>
  Also, one more thing. When troubleshooting your RSS feed in RSS readers,
  remember to occasionally unsubscribe and resubscribe and <em>clear cache</em>!
  Because often you just need to refresh it for your changes to show up.

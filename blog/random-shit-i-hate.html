Sometimes you just need to get some things out of your system, you know?</p><p>Each take has a corresponding 1 to 3 level of spiciness (🌶️) rating, based purely on <em>My own humble opinion™</em>.</p><hr><h2>Take #1 | Spicy level: 🌶️🌶️🌶️</h2><p>I hate the terms MLM and WLW. MLM sounds to me like multi-level marketing and WLW I don&rsquo;t even know how to pronounce. I much prefer the terms &ldquo;yuri&rdquo; and &ldquo;yaoi&rdquo;, or &ldquo;bara&rdquo;; at least it&rsquo;s the terms for flowers in Japanese (except yaoi ofc). Or just good ol&rsquo; gay and lesbian. &ldquo;Oh yeah, have you read this <em>double-u-el-double-u</em> romance book?????&rdquo; Bitch what???? Speak human language please.</p><h2>Take #2 | Spicy level: 🌶️🌶️</h2><p>I hate Reddit Snoos. They look extremely annoying. There is just something that makes me angry when I see some smug asshole with a custom-designed Snoo and it&rsquo;s always the most dogshit opinion out there. They have similar energy to Funkopops, where it looks like it&rsquo;s made for children or &ldquo;heckin&rsquo; quirky&rdquo; kidults and you know it&rsquo;s some fake nice millennial hiding behind it WHO JUST WANTS TO ENJOY THINGS GODDAMIT 😡</p><h2>Take #3 | Spicy level: 🌶️🌶️🌶️</h2><p>I hate KPOP Demon Hunters. I have no idea why it got so big. It feels like a psyop. Mark my words, it will be forgotten in the next year and a half completely. When I first saw the trailer it felt like something a bunch of boomer suits would make when they go hmm what do kids like these days? Kpop and Arcane yeaaah let&rsquo;s combine it, oh and sprinkle some Winx club for ✨ nostalgia ✨, it will sell well. It genuinely looks manufactured in a lab for the stanley-cup-dubai-chocolate-labubu-doll kids. Also, it has this millennial-flavored humor that is just extremely cringe-inducing.</p><h2>Take #4 | Spicy level: 🌶️</h2><p>I hate autumn and winter, mostly because here it&rsquo;s 99% just foul weather, strong, cold wind, dirt, floodings and everything feels wet and cold. It&rsquo;s not really a romantic ideal of picturesque snow fields or beautiful trees with golden leaves everywhere. It&rsquo;s genuinely depressing, especially when you are forced for whatever reason to go out and drudge through all that. I see people act like they are some mysterious introspective poet with a sense of superiority just because they like listening to rain sounds while sleeping or something. Fuck off&mldr; And I fully admit that I was such a person in my teenage years. I thought it made me cool. But really I was just lonely, isolated and had poor social skills (not anymore). Nowadays, I really like warm sunny weather. Not the heat though. It really does (pun not intended) <em>brighten my day</em>.</p><h2>Take #5 | Spicy level: 🌶️</h2><p>I hate polyester clothing. WHY THE FUCK IS IT EVERYWHERE??? It feels slippery and disgusting. What&rsquo;s wrong with basic cotton? Huh? Can&rsquo;t even buy any sweatpants of gym clothes anymore without FUCKING POLYESTER EVERYWHERE. FUCKING DOGSHIT PLASTIC TRASH.</p><h2>Take #6 | Spicy level: 🌶️🌶️</h2><p>Peanut butter is simply disgusting.</p></main><footer><p>&copy; 2025 Sqvrltastic Art Archive</p><p>Powered by Hugo & GitHub Pages</p></footer><script src=/assets/js/theme-body.v1.js></script></body></html>

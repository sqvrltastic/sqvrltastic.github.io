    <main> <h2 id="why-i-created-sqvrltastic-art-archive">Why I created &ldquo;Sqvrltastic Art Archive&rdquo;</h2>
<p>I hate how sterile, impersonal and soulless most modern web feels. The wacky and weird personal websites and forums of old got replaced with social media profiles, groups, subreddits etc. that force you into the same, sanitized, corporate mold.</p>
<p>Also, I am completely fed up with the way social media treats artists, how much pressure it puts on you to produce &ldquo;content&rdquo; all the time and I hate the whole notion of being a &ldquo;content creator&rdquo; instead of an artist. I am not a brand, I am a person.</p>
<p>Sometimes I don&rsquo;t feel like creating and posting artwork. Sometimes, I feel like trying something new, something that doesn&rsquo;t fit in my previous niche, and that&rsquo;s fine and completely normal. Yet the social media model punishes you for doing so.</p>
<p>There is certainly something to be said about commodification of art in general and the way social media frames it. Like, do I really want my art, that I put hard work in and I deeply care about, to be experienced as mere &ldquo;content&rdquo;, meant only as a cheap dopamine hit, that is looked at for 0.2 milliseconds, liked, then scrolled by and immediately followed by ten ads, five shitposts and someone&rsquo;s bad political take and now also by alarming amounts of AI generated slop? Give me a break.</p>
<h2 id="about-this-website">About this website</h2>
<p>This website was made with HUGO website builder, only using HTML5 and CSS and as of now, it&rsquo;s hosted on GitHub pages.</p>
<p>You might have noticed, but I do not have any ads, analytics or even JavaScript on my website. I understand that ads earn people money, but most of them are very distracting and resource heavy and therefore I have no moral qualms about people using ad blockers. Frankly, I think we need to find a better way to make offering free content sustainable.</p>
<p>I created this website the way it is because I don&rsquo;t want it to look &ldquo;professional&rdquo;. I want it to be&hellip; Honest. To be mine. I&rsquo;m not trying to appeal to any sort of LinkedIn recruiter or to make it digestible for everyone. Also, I just really dislike the &ldquo;round corners fruity colored blob&rdquo; design trend that&rsquo;s so prevalent with Big Tech websites.</p>
<p>On a side note, I care a lot about web accessibility, so if you notice anything that I can improve regarding this website, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out to me. For the record, I tested this website on Firefox and Edge and it should be displaying correctly on wide ranges of screen sizes. I also tested it with NVDA and most screen reader pronunciation should be fine. Keyboard only navigation should work fine too.</p>
<p>This website was created on December 3rd 2024.</p>
<h2 id="why-sqvrltastic">Why &ldquo;sqvrltastic&rdquo;?</h2>
<p>Literally no reason. It doesn&rsquo;t mean anything. I&rsquo;m just really bad with coming up with catchy, unique and memorable usernames. Uh oh!</p>
<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m a pretty private person and don&rsquo;t like sharing a lot about myself online. I grew up in an age when everybody was still somewhat apprehensive of the internet and you were advised to never share your real name or photos online. Nowadays, it&rsquo;s the opposite and oversharing is normalized and honestly I kinda hate it. I hate that if you don&rsquo;t have an active social media account people see you as some sort of serial killer, but then again, people are stupid and I don&rsquo;t care what they think of me.</p>
<p>With that out of the way&hellip; I&rsquo;m a young woman in my mid-twenties who is extremely introverted and aromantic. I speak three languages fluently: English, Montenegrin and Russian. Furthermore, I like tinkering with tech, playing old video games, watching old anime, cooking (check out my cooking website BTW!), minimalist and tidy everything and being an insufferable stuck up contrarian (sometimes).</p>
<h2 id="favorite-media">Favorite media</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m an avid PC gamer and I love a lot of old school games with dark and gritty atmosphere, the likes of Thief, S.T.A.L.K.E.R., Half-life, Wolfenstein, Dark souls and Demon&rsquo;s souls, etc.</p>
<p>A lot of those games evoke a certain feeling of solitude and isolation that I really gravitate too and find strangely comforting.</p>
<p>In particular, the original &ldquo;Thief&rdquo; trilogy of games left the biggest impact on me in how I view game design as a whole and showed me what games as a medium can achieve, without trying to imitate movies like so many modern AAA games do (<em>cough</em> Sony <em>cough</em>).</p>
<p>I also love a lot of weird, artsy and dark 80s and 90s anime. Angel&rsquo;s egg, Jin Roh: The Wolf brigade, Ghost in the shell, Vampire hunter D: Bloodlust, Legend of the galactic heroes, Berserk and such. I rarely watch anime for the plot. I think in general we overestimate the importance of &ldquo;plot&rdquo; in film and other visual media.</p>
<p>You can say that I mostly watch anime for the &ldquo;vibes&rdquo;. A purely emotional experience, not tainted by &ldquo;logic&rdquo; or &ldquo;story&rdquo;. I do really enjoy media with deep and complex characters though.</p>
<p>In general, I am of the opinion that art shouldn&rsquo;t really teach you anything per se or &ldquo;convey a message&rdquo;, because that&rsquo;s boring and preachy. If you want to share your opinion on whatever subject, write an essay instead. Art is meant for exploration.</p>
<h2 id="tools-i-use">Tools I use</h2>
<p>I use Adobe Photoshop (2019 version) as my drawing software of choice. Pirated, of course. After all, not only is it not morally wrong, it is, in fact, every artist&rsquo;s moral imperative to pirate Adobe&rsquo;s Software!..</p>
<p>My graphic tablet is Wacom Cintiq Pro 13 FHD.</p>
<p>As for 3D, I use Blender to make the model itself and then later texture it in Substance Painter (circa 2018 version), cracked.</p>
<p>For coding and development I use Visual Studio Code.</p>
<p>I also have a soft spot for traditional watercolor, but, admittedly, I rarely use it nowadays.
AI image generation</p>
<p>I disallow the usage of my artwork, even commissioned, for the use in AI training of any sort.</p>
<p>I do not &ldquo;hate&rdquo; AI, but I consider it unethical to profit of other people&rsquo;s work without giving them any compensation or even asking for consent to use it in the first place. Especially if such AI gen images are then used for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>In my opinion, all AI generation models should be opt-in, instead of opt-out by default if you want to prevent your content from being used for training. It should only be trained on content for which the author has given their permission to do so and the works generated by AI have to be explicitly labeled as such. In any other way I consider it 100% unethical.
Reposting my artwork</p>
<p>In general, I don&rsquo;t mind people reposting my artwork, but with a few caveats in mind. First, I would rather not have my artwork shared on platforms that use their content to train AI image generation models. So Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and any other platform that are known to do so.</p>
<p>Also while I do have most of my artworks watermarked, if you do share my artwork, I would still appreciate if you explicitly credit me and maybe even link to this website. Thank you.</p>

I moved the content from the "Not indie web related" section ("Other indie websites" page) there, as well one new link!

I also made the code overall more optimized, but you probably won't notice much difference as an end user.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://sqvrltastic.art/journal/free-web-hosting-services-are-not-free/</guid><title>"Free" web hosting services are not free [journal]</title><description>Lately I've been witnessing how Neocities is slowly falling apart, with Kyle only occasionally chiming in to solve only the most egregious and pressing technical issues and I have some thoughts on the matter...</description><link>https://sqvrltastic.art/journal/free-web-hosting-services-are-not-free/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Website update</title><description>Version 3.0 of the website is live! 🎉 I pretty much changed the entire website and all its sections. Also, I updated the "Animating details HTML element with pure CSS (without calc-size(auto))" guide and the "100 Questions for Webmasters" journal post and yes it's now called Journal and not Blog. And I made a new 88x31 button. PLEASE UPDATE ANY BACKLINKS THANKS and sorry for the inconvenience!</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://sqvrltastic.art/guides/animating-details-element-with-css/</guid><title>Animating details HTML element with pure CSS (without calc-size(auto)) [guide]</title><description>I needed some ingenious solution to pretty-up my details element styling. This guide is a temporary workaround until the calc-size() CSS function becomes widely available.</description><link>https://sqvrltastic.art/guides/animating-details-element-with-css/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Website update</title><description>I finally added a guestbook! Honestly, it took me so long because I am very particular regarding the features I am looking for in such a service. I also hate relying on 3rd party services, but I am too lazy to figure out how to code my own solution. Self-hosting my own guestbooks is still something I am considering doing at some point, so consider this Atabook-powered guestbook a temporary solution. I will probably move web hosts by that point though.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Website update</title><description>Lots of improvements to general usability, optimization and aesthetics of the site. Including: better details element styling, much better web font optimization, converted every artwork to .avif format and further compressed them and included a link to download a full (.jpg) version under each one, added a lot of new coding resources in the links section. Check it out! 🔥 And more! But it's mostly just code optimization.</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://sqvrltastic.art/journal/100-questions-for-webmasters/</guid><title>100 Questions for Webmasters [journal]</title><description>A fun questionaire I found, made by mouseling.

This is my first time purchasing a domain so bear with me if I inadvertently break something!</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://sqvrltastic.art/gallery/drg-driller-scout-yaoi.html</guid><title>Driller x Scout yaoi [artwork]</title><description><img src="https://sqvrltastic.art/images/full/drg-driller-scout-yaoi.jpg"/><p>Deep Rock Galactic fan art; Two characters, Driller and Scout, are depicted as looking in each other's eyes in a romantic way, with Driller grinning and Scout is visibly flustered.

Changed a bit the “buttons” page; also, I no longer allow hotlinking of my images. Added “artwork” and “blog” tags to RSS items so they are easier to filter out in case you want to. Implemented some minor code improvements regarding the way images are embedded on this website. All in all, nothing major, mostly just polishing work.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://sqvrltastic.art/gallery/lotgh-reinhard-portrait.html</guid><title>Reinhard portrait [artwork]</title><description><img src="https://sqvrltastic.art/images/full/lotgh-reinhard-portrait.jpg"/><p>Legend of the Galactic Heroes fan art; portrait of Reinhard von Lohengramm.</p></description><enclosure url="https://sqvrltastic.art/images/full/lotgh-reinhard-portrait.jpg" type="image/jpeg" length="796841"/><link>https://sqvrltastic.art/gallery/lotgh-reinhard-portrait.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Website update</title><description>Updated my “Full guide to RSS”; added a small section at the bottom about on how to make your RSS feed autodiscoverable. Additionally, added some cool new sites in the “links” section. Oh and, you can now find the HUGO source files of this website on my GitHub, if you ever wondered how I made this site the way I did.</description><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Website update</title><description>I completely remade the template for the RSS news feed and the site’s own updates feed. Well, mostly on the developer side, you yourself won’t see many differences. Basically I made a template in HUGO and automated it, whereas previously I would code it by hand, which was pretty tedious and prone to making mistakes. Make sure to clear your reader’s cache if you have any issues! Also, now every artwork has a small annotation below!</description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://sqvrltastic.art/gallery/vermintide-kerillian-drinking-leaf-lovers.html</guid><title>Kerillian drinking Leaf Lover's Special beer [artwork]</title><description><img src="https://sqvrltastic.art/images/full/vermintide-kerillian-drinking-leaf-lovers.jpg"/><p>Vermintide fan art; elf Kerillian drinking Leaf Lover's Special beer (a reference to another co-op shooter game, Deep Rock Galactic).</p></description><enclosure url="https://sqvrltastic.art/images/full/vermintide-kerillian-drinking-leaf-lovers.jpg" type="image/jpeg" length="879239"/><link>https://sqvrltastic.art/gallery/vermintide-kerillian-drinking-leaf-lovers.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://sqvrltastic.art/gallery/vermintide-kerillian-thinking-face.html</guid><title>Thinking face Kerillian [artwork]</title><description><img src="https://sqvrltastic.art/images/full/vermintide-kerillian-thinking-face.jpg"/><p>Vermintide fan art; elf Kerillian with a thinking expresion on her face.</p></description><enclosure url="https://sqvrltastic.art/images/full/vermintide-kerillian-thinking-face.jpg" type="image/jpeg" length="337638"/><link>https://sqvrltastic.art/gallery/vermintide-kerillian-thinking-face.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://sqvrltastic.art/gallery/vermintide-kerillian-smug-asuka.html</guid><title>Kerillian redraw as smug Asuka [artwork]</title><description><img src="https://sqvrltastic.art/images/full/vermintide-kerillian-smug-asuka.jpg"/><p>Vermintide fan art; Kerillian looking smug, redraw of that one screenshot of Asuka from the anime Evangelion.</p></description><enclosure url="https://sqvrltastic.art/images/full/vermintide-kerillian-smug-asuka.jpg" type="image/jpeg" length="237089"/><link>https://sqvrltastic.art/gallery/vermintide-kerillian-smug-asuka.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Website update</title><description>Deleted two blog posts (I just didn’t like them, I feel like they were too low effort). Changed my whole gallery template in HUGO to make it fully automated. This shouldn’t affect anything too much for the end user though so you won’t see many changes. Fixed some broken links, changed some stuff, yada yada, the usual. Not worth mentioning here.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://sqvrltastic.art/blog/how-to-subscribe.html</guid><title>How to subscribe to this website — a guide [blog]</title><description>A guide on how to subscribe with RSS to Sqvrltastic Art Archive to get updates when I post new content or update this site.</description><link>https://sqvrltastic.art/blog/how-to-subscribe.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Website update</title><description>My PC is still broken… (update: it’s fixed now). In the meantime, I rewrote and cleaned up a lot of CSS code on the website. For you this mostly means that there are some minor layout changes. Also, I added a big RSS feed button down in the footer section and a simple guide on how to subscribe to this website’s updates right there as well. So if you haven’t figured out how to do it already, hopefully how you will!</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Website update</title><description>Minor website CSS changes! Just trying to make this website easier on the eyes. Also, I kept the main font being monospace, but now it will show as whatever default monospace font you have in your browser, not as Courier New like before. Additionally, updated coding resources links and added “Images: figcaption vs alt. text” link under accessibility section.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2025 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Website update</title><description>Crazy to think that January is already ending. But, in any case, in today’s update I added a whole new section to my website: “Links”! I will be sharing other indie websites there, as well as resources that I find useful and just cool and funny stuff!</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://sqvrltastic.art/blog/markdown-cheat-sheet.html</guid><title>Markdown cheat sheet [blog]</title><description>Markdown is a lightweight markup language that lets you add formatting elements to plaintext documents.

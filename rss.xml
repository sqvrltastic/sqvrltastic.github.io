Changed a bit the “buttons” page; also, I no longer allow hotlinking of my images. Added “artwork” and “blog” tags to RSS items so they are easier to filter out in case you want to.

All in all, nothing major, mostly just polishing work.</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://sqvrltastic.art/gallery/lotgh-reinhard-portrait.html</guid><title>Reinhard portrait [artwork]</title><description><img src="https://sqvrltastic.art/assets/images/compressed/lotgh-reinhard-portrait.avif"/><p>[alt text] Black and white pencil-style sketch portrait of Reinhard von Lohengramm</p></description><enclosure url="https://sqvrltastic.art/assets/images/compressed/lotgh-reinhard-portrait.avif" type="image/avif" length="250502"/><link>https://sqvrltastic.art/gallery/lotgh-reinhard-portrait.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Website update</title><description>Updated my “Full guide to RSS”; added a small section at the bottom about on how to make your RSS feed autodiscoverable. Additionally, added some cool new sites in the “links” section. Oh and, you can now find the HUGO source files of this website on my GitHub, if you ever wondered how I made this site the way I did.</description><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Website update</title><description>I completely remade the template for the RSS news feed and the site’s own updates feed. Well, mostly on the developer side, you yourself won’t see many differences. Basically I made a template in HUGO and automated it, whereas previously I would code it by hand, which was pretty tedious and prone to making mistakes. Make sure to clear your reader’s cache if you have any issues! Also, now every artwork has a small annotation below!</description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://sqvrltastic.art/gallery/vermintide-kerillian-drinking-leaf-lovers.html</guid><title>Kerillian drinking Leaf Lover's Special beer [artwork]</title><description><img src="https://sqvrltastic.art/assets/images/compressed/vermintide-kerillian-drinking-leaf-lovers.avif"/><p>[alt text] elf Kerillian drinking Leaf Lover's Special beer with an annoyed expression on her face</p></description><enclosure url="https://sqvrltastic.art/assets/images/compressed/vermintide-kerillian-drinking-leaf-lovers.avif" type="image/avif" length="273037"/><link>https://sqvrltastic.art/gallery/vermintide-kerillian-drinking-leaf-lovers.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://sqvrltastic.art/gallery/vermintide-kerillian-thinking-face.html</guid><title>Thinking face Kerillian [artwork]</title><description><img src="https://sqvrltastic.art/assets/images/compressed/vermintide-kerillian-thinking-face.avif"/><p>[alt text] elf Kerillian with a thinking expresion on her face</p></description><enclosure url="https://sqvrltastic.art/assets/images/compressed/vermintide-kerillian-thinking-face.avif" type="image/avif" length="91641"/><link>https://sqvrltastic.art/gallery/vermintide-kerillian-thinking-face.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

the digital era. Countless guides on topics such as reducing your digital footprint, "debloating"
your OS,
curbing your
social media addiction, et cetera, et cetera; have been written, some good, some mediocre and I'm about to add my
own one to the growing pile...</p><p>Is it really a proper guide though? Not really, I suppose. It will be mainly focused on making desktop and mobile
internet browsing less annoying. This is pretty much <strong>my own</strong> setup at the moment that I have been
running for
a few years now.</p><blockquote><p>"But what if I don't like (X) thing??????"</p></blockquote><p>OK? Don't use it then? I'm not saying that this
will be an ideal setup for absolutely everyone, it's more of a list of tips and tricks you might find useful.</p><h2 id=choosing-your-desktop-drowser>Choosing your desktop browser</h2><figure class=figure-annotation><img class=big-image src=/assets/images/editorial/firefox-cosplay-girl.avif alt="girl wearing sexy Firefox cosplay sitting with a huge globus"><figcaption>I don't know the name of the girl, sorry, this picture is very old</figcaption></figure><p>Despite everything, I'm still using <strong>Firefox</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>"But sqvrltastic, I've heard that Firefox added AI and telemetry???
Why not switch to Brave/Librewolf/[insert another shilled meme browser here]????????"</p></blockquote><p>BECAUSE, they are ALL either:</p><ul><li>Insecure buggy garbage (browsers are hard to develop, surprise!).</li><li>Repackaged Chrome (Brave) and we don't want the entire internet to be dominated by Chromium-based browsers
because <em>reasons™</em> that are beyond the scope of this guide.</li><li>They are just a Firefox fork (slightly modified code) with few settings tweaked that are slightly behind in
updates (Librewolf)</li><li>They are used and developed for a very niche and specific purpose and not very suitable for daily use (Tor,
which is also
based on Firefox)</li></ul><p>Firefox isn't perfect, but as of right now, there really isn't a widespread alternative FOSS internet browser
besides
ol' foxy, unfortunately. <strong>I am in fact, 100% correct on this, btw.</strong></p><h2 id=changing-the-default-browser-settings>Changing default browser settings</h2><p>Anyway... First thing, go to your browser settings. The main settings that we'll want to tweak are:</p><ol><li>In "Home":</li><ul><li>We will be using <strong>Tabliss</strong> extension for homepage and new windows (that I will elaborate more
on
later) for the ultimate minimalism aesthetic.</li><li>Untick "Support Firefox" and "Recent activity"</li></ul><li>In "Search":</li><ul><li>Default search engine — I use DuckDuckGo. Google is too censored and filled with irrelevant crap nowadays.</li><li>Show search suggestions — I untick this.</li><li>Address bar — ✅ Bookmarks, ✅ Suggest search engines to use and ✅ Quick actions, everything else is unticked.</li><li>Search shortcuts — you really only need Google, DuckDuckGo and your Bookmarks (use them btw they're useful).</li></ul><li>In "Privacy and Security":</li><ul><li>Tracking protection — Strict. You can tick "fix major site issues" but I had it unticked and never had a
site
break on me that I remember.</li><li>Tick the "Tell websites not to share my data"</li><li>Passwords — Untick "Ask to save passwords" since we will be using a password manager.</li><li>Payment methods — untick "Save and autofill payment info"</li><li>History — Choose <strong>"Never remember history"</strong> (permanent private browsing mode). <strong>Very
important</strong> for me, but maybe a bit controversial. Yes, that means that <strong>you will have to
login
into websites each time you relaunch your browser</strong> (although you can autofill login data with
password manager). I
genuinely
like
it this way more and it's one more barrier from getting sucked into social media doomscrolling. I prefer to
stay logged out of almost everything when browsing anyway.</li><li>Permissions — choose to block everything.</li><li>Firefox data collection (telemetry) — untick everything.</li><li>Security — personally, I have everything enabled here.</li><li>DNS over HTTPS — choose max protection and leave it at "Cloudflare" if you have no idea what DNS provider to
choose.</li><li>I don't use Sync or Mozilla account</li></ul></ol><h2 id=disabling-ai-related-features-in-firefox>Disabling AI-related features in Firefox</h2><p>Yeah, in case you didn't know, Firefox has also jumped on the AI bandwagon recently. Did anybody ask? Of course not.</p><ol><li>Enter "about:config" into the address bar.</li><li>Type ".ml" and just go through everything that looks like an AI feature and turn it off. Most of it
takes
either "true" or "false" as values and it's easy to figure out what each setting does from its name.</li></ol><p>Here is a full list of my own modified preferences:</p><details class=animation-medium><summary>Disabling Firefox AI features</summary><table><thead><tr><th>Preference</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>browser.ml.chat.enabled</td><td>false</td><tr><tr><td>browser.ml.chat.hideLocalhost</td><td>false</td><tr><tr><td>browser.ml.chat.menu</td><td>false</td><tr><tr><td>browser.ml.chat.nimbus</td><td class=text-break-all>ai-chatbot-page-summarization-mvp-treatment-a-callout-badge-rollout-v2:treatment-a-callout-badge</td><tr><tr><td>browser.ml.chat.page</td><td>false</td><tr><tr><td>browser.ml.chat.page.footerBadge</td><td>false</td><tr><tr><td>browser.ml.chat.page.menuBadge</td><td>false</td><tr><tr><td>browser.ml.chat.shortcuts</td><td>false</td><tr><tr><td>browser.ml.chat.shortcuts.custom</td><td>false</td><tr><tr><td>browser.ml.chat.sidebar</td><td>false</td><tr><tr><td>browser.ml.checkForMemory</td><td>false</td><tr><tr><td>browser.ml.enable</td><td>false</td><tr><tr><td>browser.ml.linkPreview.blockListEnabled</td><td>false</td><tr><tr><td>browser.ml.linkPreview.longPress</td><td>false</td><tr><tr><td>extensions.ml.enabled</td><td>false</td><tr><tr><td>extensions.ui.mlmodel.hidden</td><td>true</td><tr></tbody></table></details><h2 id=firefox-extensions>Firefox Extensions</h2><p>I use:</p><ul><li>Ublock Origin (with some custom rules listed below)</li><li>SponsorBlock for YouTube (skips YT video filler like sponsorship segments)</li><li>NoScript (optional, only if you know what you're doing because it will break a lot of websites; I love it
though, it nukes all the distracting JS bells and whistles)</li><li>Bitwarden (my password manager of choice, but you can use another one like KeePassXC for example, if you
want)</li><li>Tabliss (to customize your new page and make it clean and minimal)</li><li>Simple Translate (optional)</li><li>Awesome RSS (optional, if you use RSS)</li></ul><p>Most of the extensions are pretty self-explanatory. Just download and install them and check the "allow to run
in private window" when prompted.</p><p>If you're using Bitwarden, go to settings > security > vault timeout > "Never". If you are using a
desktop,
chances are it's not going to be easily stolen so it's fine and more convenient.</p><p>As for Ublock, it can block other things besides annoying ads! If you want to remove an element on a webpage
that
you
don't like, right click on it and use the "Block element..." option, it will bring the Ublock menu. It can get
pretty advanced! Down below are some of the <strong>custom Ublock Origin rules</strong> that I've made for myself...</p><h2 id=setting-up-custom-ublock-origin-filters>Setting up Ublock Origin custom filters</h2><p>To add custom rules, you need to:</p><ol><li>Click on your Ublock Origin icon in the browser toolbar</li><li>Find a ⚙️ icon that says "Open the dashboard"</li><li>Go to "My filters" section</li></ol><p>I will say that I am not really some Ublock Origin wizard and there is probably a cleaner way to write some of these
rules, but they <em>do</em> work.</p><h2 id=reddit-custom-ublock-origin-filters>Reddit custom Ublock Origin filters</h2><p>I use Ublock to remove the distracting sidebars and most importantly, the home feed, which is always an endless
scroll of usual plebbit garbage, <s>like US politics ragebait and shit relationship advice</s>.</p><details class=animation-medium><summary>Reddit Ublock Origin filters</summary><pre><code>! Reddit settings

</code></pre></details><p>Also, although reddit doesn't really have an option to blacklist certain words or mute certain users (without
outright blocking them), we can use Ublock to automatically hide from out feed posts that contain certain
<strong>keywords</strong> ANYWHERE in the post structure.</p><p>For example:</p><details><summary>Reddit keyword filters</summary><pre><code>! Reddit posts keyword filters
www.reddit.com##article.m-0.w-full:has-text(/canada/i)
www.reddit.com##article.m-0.w-full:has-text(/war/i)
www.reddit.com##article.m-0.w-full:has-text(/amazon/i)
! Remove borders from blacklisted posts (to make it look prettier)
www.reddit.com##hr.border-b-neutral-border-weak.border-solid.border-b-sm.border-0
</code></pre></details><p>Just replace it with your own keywords. Do note that you will have to specify both singular and plural nouns (if
applicable for your use case).</p><p><strong><time datetime=2026-02-27>02/27/2026</time> update:</strong> There is a very rare quirk that can occur —
If you go to a /u/ (user's) page and have, for example, word "lemon" filtered, some posts that do not have any
mention of the word "lemon" in their heading or body, will <strong>still get filtered out</strong> if the word
"lemon"
is still present in the description of the subreddit itself. <strong>This is not the case</strong> when you browse
<em>any</em> /r/ (subreddits) though; in that case, the word filter <strong>works as expected</strong> and only
fiters out the posts
that have a blacklisted work in their heading, username, flair, or body.</p><div class=note-box><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Did you know that, although Reddit prompts you with a mandatory login wall when
viewing NSFW content on the
redesigned version of its site, if you switch to <code class=text-break-all><strong>old</strong>.reddit.com/r/your-link-here</code>, you can actually
bypass the login wall?
Kinda nifty. <s>Don't ask me why I know.</s></p></div><h2 id=youtube-custom-ublock-origin-filters>YouTube custom Ublock Origin filters</h2><p>I like to remove the entire home feed, recommended and watch later sections. They are useless and are there just
to
keep you watching.</p><blockquote><p>Disable recommendations??! BUT HOW WILL I GET RECOMMENDED MY highly intellectual 1h long video game
essays?????!?!?!?! <i>🤓</i></p></blockquote><p>Consoom product, smh.</p><p>Let's be real here, <strong>99% of video essays are trash</strong>.</p><p>I used to watch them, so I get it. But let's be real, nowadays, every time I watch one of them, it's just
worthless yapping for 90% of time and 10% some
super basic "wow no shit Sherlock" opinion that has been regurgitated countless times, again and again.</p><p>People like them for the same reason they like arguing with random
strangers on Reddit (who are probably just <a href=https://www.pcmag.com/news/researchers-secretly-unleash-ai-bots-on-popular-change-my-view-subreddit target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">ChatGPT
bots</a> or some literal piss-drinking weirdo on the other side of
the world) —
because it makes them feel smart. It's pseudo-intellectualism at its finest. Next time you watch such a video
essay, try to actually remember what it was about and summarize the key points. Bet you can't, smh.</p><p>Anyway, here are the filters:</p><details><summary>YouTube Ublock Origin filters</summary><pre><code>! YouTube settings

</code></pre></details><p>Hit <kbd>T</kbd> for theater view, I like it more that way.</p><p>Another problem I face is that YouTube is now forcing autoplay on every video you click on through YouTube
search.
Unfortunately, I don't know how to easily and conveniently disable this behavior. However, what you can do (at
least), is remove the extra parameters from the default link that YouTube gives you.</p><p>What do I mean by this? Here is an example:</p><pre><code>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOZuxwVk7TU&amp;list=RDLOZuxwVk7TU&amp;start_radio=1</code></pre><p>This is what your URL bar looks like when you click on a video. Now, <strong>remove everything</strong> after the
<code>watch?v=LOZuxwVk7TU</code>, that means the entire <code>&amp;list=RDLOZuxwVk7TU&amp;start_radio=1</code>
section. So that in the end, your URL looks like this:</p><pre><code>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOZuxwVk7TU</code></pre><p>For now, this returns the autoplay toggle button! Yay! Also, wtf YouTube???</p><h2 id=phone>Phone</h2><p>I don't use my phone a lot. You really can't do anything productive on such a tiny screen and I really try to
avoid using it for "entertainment". As such, I only have messaging apps and YouTube client, as well
as some stuff like password manager, 2FA apps, Brave browser and of course, system apps. Also, I try to resist using
my phone simply because I feel bored.</p><p>Delete all social media apps if you still use social media. Yes, everything. Reddit, TikTok, Instagram,
everything.
Unless you use it for work, of course. I only use social media (mainly Reddit) on my PC nowadays (except for mobile
Steam app, <s>so I'm a hypocrite, I guess</s>).</p><p>If you have Android, download the <strong>PipePipe</strong> YouTube client. There are other 3rd party clients, but I
find PipePipe to
be the one with the least distractions, so perfect for my use case. Everything is stored 100% locally (the power of
RSS technology!) and you don't need a YouTube account to use it.</p><p>Oh and <strong>it lets you watch videos with the phone screen off!</strong> YIPPIE!</p><img src=/assets/images/other/happy-jumping-cat.webp alt="happy cat jumping" width=132 height=128 class=img-border><p>Now, go to the PipePipe settings and configure the following:</p><ul><li>Disable watch and search history.</li><li>Go to "Content" > "Content on main page", here you really need just the "What's new", "Subscriptions" and
"Bookmarked playlists". You don't need any random trending videos.</li><li>Also, while in "Content", disable: search suggestions, comments, video description, "show next and similar",
dislike count and future items.</li></ul><p>I don't use Spotify or any steaming services, <em>at all</em>.</p><blockquote><p>But what about <strong>IOS</strong>?</p></blockquote><figure class=figure-annotation><img class=big-image src=/assets/images/editorial/herd-of-sheep.avif alt="herd of sheep grazing"><figcaption>YOU <i>🫵 🐑</i></figcaption></figure><p>You're fucked.

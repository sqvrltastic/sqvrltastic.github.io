<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia:</a></p><blockquote cite=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS>"RSS (which stands for "Really Simple Syndication") is a web feed that
allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a
standardized, computer-readable format."</blockquote><p>In layman terms, basically, RSS is a website's news feed that is standardized
and which makes it possible for you to "subscribe" to your favorite website's
news feed without actually creating an account there or signing up with your
email for a newsletter or anything like that.</p><p>On its own, RSS feed appears as a file in an XML format with a weird looking
code inside that looks similar to HTML. You will need an RSS feed reader
program to actually convert that code to a human-readable feed.</p><p>There are <em>a lot</em> of RSS readers out there, both for PC and mobile,
personally I use
<a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9p71fc94lrh8?hl=en-us&gl=US" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">"Fluent Reader"</a>
on my Windows PC; you can get it from Microsoft Store. It's completely free
and the code is open source. On mobile, I use
<a href=https://f-droid.org/packages/com.nononsenseapps.feeder/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">"Feeder"</a>.</p><h2 id=why-use-rss>Why use RSS?</h2><p>Because social media feeds suck. You always get irrelevant, garbage posts, ads
and you often don't even see the posts from people that you follow because of
the algorithm. Not to mention that, often you can get distracted and you have
to manually check each website individually. With RSS, you have all of your
subscriptions in one place.</p><p>You can subscribe to news sites, blogs, personal websites (if they have an RSS
feed implemented) and also Tumblr blogs, subreddits, AO3, Bluesky profile
feeds and even YouTube channels and many more! Though, take note that not
every website takes its RSS feed seriously (shame!) and some of them are a bit
poorly implemented.</p><p>Also, RSS is much better in terms of privacy and security because you don't
need to give anyone your data, like in the case of signing up to an email
newsletter with your email.</p><h2 id=for-users-how-to-use-rss>For users: How to use RSS</h2><p>As I said already, you will need an RSS feed reader program. On PC, you can
use Fluent Reader like I do, or choose whichever one you like the most. They
are mostly similar.</p><p>On mobile, as previously mentioned, I use Feeder, but you can just search for
"RSS reader" in whichever app store you have installed on your phone. Also,
there is the
<a href=https://f-droid.org/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">F-Droid</a>
app store that has only
<abbr title="free open source software">FOSS</abbr> apps there, meaning, those
are usually apps that don't track you and don't show you ads or beg you to buy
in-app purchases. I personally use it and can fully recommend it.</p><p>First, go to the website you want to subscribe to. Look for the RSS logo that
usually looks like a Wi-Fi symbol over an orange background (<img src=/assets/images/other/rss.svg alt width=15 height=15 class=img-inline>). Click on it; it should take you to the website's RSS feed. Simply
copy
the URL, launch your RSS feed reader, look for a button that says something
along the lines of "add new source" and paste it there.</p><p>If you can't find the RSS icon, don't fret. Try looking for an RSS feed by
accessing it directly through your browser's address bar. Usually, the
website's RSS feed is located at
<span class=text-break-all>https://www.website.com/rss.xml</span>, or at
<span class=text-break-all>https://www.website.com/index.xml</span>, or at
<span class=text-break-all>https://www.website.com/rss</span>, but it can
vary. As an example, this website's RSS is located
<a href=/rss.xml>here</a>.</p><p>Some social media have a hidden RSS feed that you can access; some examples:</p><p><strong>Tumblr:</strong>
<span class=text-break-all>https://<i>username</i>.tumblr.com/rss</span></p><p><strong>Bluesky:</strong>
<span class=text-break-all>https://bsky.app/profile/<i>username</i>/rss</span></p><p><strong>Reddit:</strong>
<span class=text-break-all>https://www.reddit.com/r/<em>subredditname</em>.rss</span>
or
<span class=text-break-all>https://www.reddit.com/u/<em>username</em>.rss</span></p><p><strong>YouTube:</strong> Requires a bit of code digging, unfortunately. On
PC:</p><details class=animation-medium><summary>(show steps)</summary><ol><li>Open the YouTube channel in your browser.</li><li>Right-click "view page source".</li><li>Press Ctrl + F on your keyboard.</li><li>Search for "browse_id" (without the quotation marks).</li><li>You should find a part of the code that looks like this:
<code class=text-break-all>{"key":"browse_id","value":"<i>UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw</i>"}</code>, copy the
string
of random letters and numbers that is inside the
"value" field, that is the channel's ID.</li><li>Create a working URL to YouTube's channel RSS feed by replacing the
"CHANNELID" part inside this URL template:
<span class=text-break-all>https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=<i>CHANNELID</i></span>
with the ID you just copied.</li></ol></details><p>Alternatively, on Android, just use
<a href=https://f-droid.org/packages/InfinityLoop1309.NewPipeEnhanced/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">PipePipe</a>
(my current fav), NewPipe or whatever other software fork there is.</p><p>Feel free to look up online if a website has an RSS feed. A lot of them do,
but they can be hidden.</p><h2 id=for-developers-how-to-add-an-rss-feed-to-your-website>For developers: How to add an RSS feed to your website</h2><p>Now that I have hopefully convinced you of how great RSS is, here is a
tutorial on how to actually implement it and add it to your website.</p><p>Some website builders or <abbr title="static site generators">SSGs</abbr>,
like for example Hugo which I use, have an option to auto generate RSS feeds,
but I personally prefer not to use it and instead I prefer to manually write
updates to my RSS feed, at least for this website. That way I feel I have more
control.</p><p>First, create a <strong>rss.xml</strong> file in the root directly of your
website (meaning,
<em>the top-most folder where all of your website's content resides</em>).
Then, copy and paste the code below. Keep the overall structure and replace
the content of each field with your own where applicable.</p><details class=animation-medium><summary>Base of your RSS feed (show code)</summary><pre><code><span class=text-colored>&#x3C;?xml version=&#x22;1.0&#x22; encoding=&#x22;UTF-8&#x22;?&#x3E;

refresh the page. Time is set in minutes. Putting 1440 as value means that
your RSS feed refreshes once a day, which is enough if you don't update your
website all that often.</p><p><code>&lt;webMaster></code> — <em>optional</em>; your email for contact.</p><p><code>&lt;lastBuildDate></code> — timestamp that shows the last time the
RSS feed was updated, in RFC2822 format. You can generate an RFC 2822
timestamp on sites like the
<a href=https://timestampgenerator.com/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">UNIX timestamp generator</a>. It
looks something like this when generated: Sat, 28 Dec 2024 16:26:14
+0000.</p><p><code>&lt;pubDate></code> — timestamp that shows when the individual item
was published, in RFC2822 format. Similar to
<code>&lt;lastBuildDate></code>.</p><p><code>&lt;guid></code> — (from
<a href=https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification#ltguidgtSubelementOfLtitemgt target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">rssboard.org</a>):</p><blockquote cite=https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification#ltguidgtSubelementOfLtitemgt>"<code>&lt;guid></code> is an optional sub-element of

rssboard.org; a sub element of <code>&lt;item></code> that allows for
embedding media; in my case, images.</p><p>I did some tests and found out that on some RSS readers, using only the
<code>&lt;enclosure></code> element is not enough and it doesn't embed the
image, but on others it does. It seems a bit inconsistent. That is why I
always use the <code>&lt;img></code> tag inside the
<code>&lt;description></code> element because I found that to be the most
foolproof way to add images to RSS items, but I usually prefer to add
<code>&lt;enclosure></code> element as well because it doesn't hurt I
suppose.</p><details class=animation-medium><summary><span>Some more info about the <code>&lt;enclosure></code> element...</span></summary><p><code>&lt;enclosure></code> has three attributes: <code>url</code>,
<code>length</code> and <code>type</code>. <code>url</code> is a link that
points to your media file's location, <code>length</code> is the size of the
file in bytes and <code>type</code> specifies the media type (<abbr title="Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions">MIME</abbr>
type).</p><p>Note that, while MIME type and file format are not exactly the same thing,
in practice they often closely align. For example, if you have a .jpg image,
the MIME type would be "image/<i>jpeg</i>".</p><p>To get the <code>length</code> of a file (in my case, image), go to a folder
where the image is located, open a bash terminal <em>in that folder</em> and
enter a command: <code>stat --format=%s <i>your-image-name.jpg</i></code>. Copy the string of numbers you've got.</p><p>Since I'm on Windows I use Git Bash and I will assume that you know at least
remotely how to use it. There are other ways to do this, but I found this
one to be the simplest one.</p></details><p>Now, hard part is over, now you just need to combine the two and fill your RSS
feed with posts... Below is an example of how that might look like.</p><details class=animation-extra-long><summary>Combining it all together (show code)</summary><pre><code><span class=text-colored>&#x3C;?xml version=&#x22;1.0&#x22; encoding=&#x22;UTF-8&#x22;?&#x3E;

<strong>special characters</strong> in your RSS feed, like "&" for example,
    make sure to write them as a HTML entity, so as "&#x26;#x26;" (without the
quotation marks) in this case. Here is a basic
<a href=https://mothereff.in/html-entities target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML entity encoder/decoder</a>.</p></div><h2 id=favicons>Favicons</h2><p>In my experience, some RSS readers seem to completely
ignore favicons, while some don't, it's a bit inconsistent. Although, after
some testing, I found that the most sure way to have an RSS reader actually
recognize and fetch your website's favicon is <em>to make sure</em> it's
located in the root directory of your website and that it's named something
like "favicon.ico".</p><h2 id=linking-your-rss-feed-in-the-head-section>Linking your RSS feed in the &lt;head> section</h2><p>After you have created your RSS feed,
you can add a button to your site
linking to it.</p><p><em>But</em>, in addition to that, you can also add a
<code>&lt;link></code> tag inside your website's
<code>&lt;head></code> tag and link your RSS feed there as well. You
can even have multiple feeds, just give them descriptive names that make
sense! See the code below...</p><details><summary>Linking the RSS feed</summary><p>Put this inside the <code>&lt;head></code> tag:</p><pre><code>&#x3C;link 
    rel=&#x22;alternate&#x22; 
    type=&#x22;application/rss+xml&#x22; 
    title=&#x22;<i>RSS feed for my site</i>&#x22; 
    href=&#x22;https://<i>my-website</i>/rss.xml&#x22; 
/&#x3E;</code></pre></details><p>What it does is it makes it your RSS feed autodiscoverable... Sorta. Well,
back in the ye olden days, most browsers had a built-in RSS reader and they
could automatically detect if a website had RSS feed. Nowadays, that
functionality is mostly gone (shame!), but, fret not, at least for Firefox,
there are extensions such as <a href=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/awesome-rss/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Awesome RSS</a>
that returns that functionality! After you install it, if a website has a
fetchable RSS feed, at the corner of your browser's address bar you will see
an RSS icon.</p><h2 id=final-words>Final words</h2><p>Also, one more thing. When <strong>troubleshooting</strong> your RSS feed in
RSS readers, remember to occasionally unsubscribe and resubscribe and
<em>clear cache</em>! Because often you just need to refresh it for your
changes to show up.</p><p>You can read more about the official RSS documentation on

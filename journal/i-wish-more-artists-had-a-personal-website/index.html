I wish that more artists, instead of looking for <strong>"The Next App™"</strong> to post their work to, would make a personal website instead. Yeah, the learning curve can be a bit steep, especially if you want to learn (and I strongly recommend it for this use case) <abbr title="Static Site Generators">SSGs</abbr>, like Hugo. But I swear, it's <em>so</em> worth it! It's also a pretty fun and useful hobby...</p><p><em>Slight tangent here;</em> honestly, I think if I had to start over, I might have gone for 11ty or Astro because their intro tutorial is much, much better than Hugo's and that's honestly my main gripe with Hugo... Hugo's documentation fucking sucks and people on official forums are often really smug, grumpy and condescending assholes. <del>And if that makes you feel butthurt and defensive, well, maybe you are the issue.</del></p><p>But yeah, learning Hugo (and to be fair, I'm still learning it, and I'm considering learning Go sometime in the future as well) was sometimes like trying to decipher borderline esoteric manuscripts in foreign language. Don't get me wrong, for the most part, now that I figured it out, I do enjoy Hugo and don't feel like switching. It's fast. And while that might not seem like a huge deal if your website had only 15 to 20 pages, us artists might have thousands of artworks and generating all those pages can take a while with SSGs written in other programming languages (for the record, Hugo is written in Go).</p><p>Also FYI, I decided to go with Hugo in the first place simply because it was, at one point, shilled a lot by a few Linux YouTubers I watched at the time.</p><p>/end of infodump</p><p>Anyway... I really wish that, when I discover a new artist, I can go on their own handcrafted website instead of Insta or Twitter, or, in rarer cases, Tumblr or <del>BS</del> (lol!!! LMAO!!!) sorry, BlueSky. Visiting a personal website feels like being a guest in someone's home.</p><p>Also, I would really want to build community with fellow artists <em>that I like</em> and exchange buttons, visit each other's websites and follow each other's web weaving progress, leave messages in guest books <del>(I'm still planning to add on to my site I swear!!!)</del>, actually see new updates in RSS feeds etc... Just building a more human and more slow, calmer and ultimately more fulfilling and enriching web together!</p><p>Another point to make is that social media promotes shallow, unfulfilling interactions. Like just liking someone's work. And actually, you can add "likes" or "kudos" on your own site too if you want. But I honestly don't really like them. I would much rather contact people directly and express my appreciation of their work in the comments or DMs (or in guest books and emails).</p><p>I know some people are shy and worry that they might be "cringy", in which case, <strong>STOP!!! REALLY, STOP BEING SHY!!!</strong> It's not good for you! Just start small and just try to talk to strangers sometimes! It can be pretty fun and fulfilling!</p><p>Lastly, I already said it before, but if you want to actually own Musk, <strong>leave his platform</strong>, instead of doing your lazy retweeting slacktivism and virtue signaling nonsense.</p></main></div><div id=right-column><ul id=social-media><li><a href=https://www.reddit.com/user/sqvrltastic/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src=/assets/images/icons/reddit.png alt=Reddit class=icon></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/sqvrltastic target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src=/assets/images/icons/github.png alt=Github class=icon></a></li><li><a href=/rss.xml target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src=/assets/images/icons/rss.png alt=RSS class=icon></a></li><li><a href=mailto:sqvrltastic@gmail.com><img src=/assets/images/icons/email.png alt=Email class=icon></a></li></ul><button id=theme-toggle aria-label="toggle theme">

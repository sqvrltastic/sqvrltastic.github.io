Updated: <time datetime=2026-01-27>01/27/2026</time></p></header><p>A fun questionnaire I found, made by <a href=https://mouseling.net/100webmaster target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">mouseling</a>.
I was itching to write something lately (and I'll probably update this website a bit later as well) and this is a
perfect way to warm up my writing
muscles. Warning for <strong>Brutal Honesty™</strong> ahead.</p><p><i>Also, I fixed a few of the author's typos and grammatical errors in the questions themselves here and there,
just
FYI.</i></p><p>Anyway...</p><hr><dl><dt>1. Please introduce yourself.</dt><dd>I'm sqvrltastic, a young woman in my mid 20s from Montenegro. I am an artist and an indie web enthusiast. I game
and
watch old anime in my spare time.</dd><dt>2. How long have you been making websites?</dt><dd><p>I think I made my first website waaay back in the late 2000s/early 2010s era. It was a fan site for an anime
Tokyo Mew Mew that I hand coded in Microsoft Frontpage. I think I hosted it at narod.ru at first, but when
they removed
the HTML editor I moved to uCoz. I don't remember what happened, but eventually I abandoned it.</p><p>However, that was a long time ago and I abandoned coding after a while and got busy with other things.
However, around a year ago I decided to actually learn website development <em>for real</em> this time and I
spent my
free time pretty much learning most things from scratch, since a lot of web dev practices changed a lot
since the late 2000s.</p></dd><dt>3. And what got you into the hobby?</dt><dd><p>I initially decided to create my first website at around 10 years old because I got inspired by this
beautiful
website
called <a href=https://rainbow-knights.narod.ru/main01.htm target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Рыцари Радуги
—
фан сайт (Rainbow Knight fan site)</a>, hosted on narod.ru. It's dedicated to a Russian comic I loved at
that
time. I
still think fondly of it, despite it being borderline lost media. I remember it... Also, I loved the <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20240904105245/https://yula-jurnal.narod.ru/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Yula fan site</a> (archived copy) and the <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106105145/https://www.yula-best.ru/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">official Yula magazine page</a> (archived copy). There are some other anime
related
websites that I remember, I even remember the visuals, but I don't remember what they were called,
unfortunately.</p><p>I remember this one site in particular that had some shoujo anime graphics, specifically a large banner at
the top, a small chatbox/guestbook on the right side, and I think the content was in the center. I think the
overall color
palette was on the warmer side... I remember chatting with the webmistress and I remember she has a section
on her
site where you could send your own site for review and critique and it would then be featured there, and I
sent mine
and got some good feedback. 🙂 Unfortunately, I can't remember the site's name.</p><p>And I got into the hobby again because I became disillusioned with the state of the modern internet and
social
media.
Also, I needed a place to serve as a safe haven for my art, and none of the social media really met my
criteria
anymore.</p></dd><dt>4. What kind of website are you most interested in?</dt><dd>I would love it if the fanartists and fic writers that I follow on social media made a website for their works.
Doesn't
have to be anything fancy, in fact I prefer designs that are straightforward and don't get in the way. Just
something
that has an RSS feed so I can follow them outside of their shitty walled garden platforms like Tumblr or
Twitter.</dd><dt id=5>5. What's your workflow? Do you plan your websites out thoroughly or do you come up with the design as you go
along?</dt><dd>I start by deciding what will be the core purpose of my site, and/or what kind of content I want to host on it.
Then, I
decide how to organize and structure said content and create design that fits.</dd><dt>6. Please link to your biggest inspirations.</dt><dd>I don't have any yet, for better or worse. I am very particular about what I like and what I am trying to
achieve
with
my website and I have pretty high standards for myself and others. There are some websites on the indie web
where I
enjoy a lot of aspects of them, but there is always some part of them that I would do differently and in my
opinion,
"better". I guess it's the great thing about the personal web — you can always do your own thing the way you
like
it,
irrespective of what is trendy at the moment.</dd><dt>7. What's your favorite part about making websites?</dt><dd>Honestly, I'm not sure. I guess I really like organizing things and cleaning up my code. It's probably not
something
that a lot of people that casually browse my site notice, but I am very meticulous about it.</dd><dt>8. And the thing you struggle with the most?</dt><dd><p>Good design lol. Or rather, a <em>good</em> maximalist, elaborate design that looks both pretty <em>and</em>
doesn't
compromise
the
usability of the site and doesn't detract from the main content of the site. I think most webmasters at
places
like
Neocities fail at both, if I'm being honest. That's the main reason I stick with a somewhat bland, <em>true
minimalist</em>
design. I would like to design my own fancy graphics for my site, maybe one day...</p></dd><dt>9. Do you keep the same layout on all of your pages? Or do you use different ones?</t><dd>Same layout on the entire site. I despise it when I click on a link and the whole layout changes, it feels
really
disorienting, like I accidentally landed on a whole different website. They can be done well, but most of the
time
they
are done extremely poorly IMO.</dd><dt>10. How confident are you with CSS?</dt><dd>Pretty confident. I can do most things with CSS and HTML5 where others lean on JavaScript as a crutch.</dd><dt>11. Do you know how to correctly use <code>&lt;dl></code> ?</dt><dd><s>I had to search it up. Never used it before.</s> I'm using it right now to format this list! Pretty nifty.</dd><dt>12. What is your favorite HTML element?</dt><dd><p>Kind of a silly question. Favorite HTML element? Do you want me to sign your friendship book too, maybe?..
<s>Actually, it's <code><s>&lt;details></s></code></s>.</p></dd><dt>13. If you're making a new web page from scratch, what is the first thing you do?</dt><dd><p>Check <a href=#5>>>5</a>.</p></dd><dt>14. Do you know JavaScript?</dt><dd>A bit.</dd><dt>15. How about PHP?</dt><dd>I don't know it, and I'd rather avoid it.</dd><dt>16. Does your website have a theme that you stick to?</dt><dd><p>Well, <em>yeah</em>.</p></dd><dt>17. Are you more focused on content or design?</dt><dd><p>Content 100%. The job of the design is to frame it well and <em>get out of the way</em>, most of the time at
least.</p></dd><dt>18. Do you own a domain name? If not, would you ever want to?</dt><dd>Yes! I love my domain name. 💖</dd><dt>19. What do you think of nostalgia-focused or "retro" websites?</dt><dd><p>Hoo boy... Here it comes. Well, if I'm being <em>brutally honest</em>, I think most of them are pretty
terrible, to put it
mildly. I get that a lot of Neocities users are kids, but still... Bunch of shit code filled with
self-absorbed
navel-gazers with no style or substance. I truly wish the whole 90s Neocities LARP trend just fucking dies
already.
Also, a lot of actual web 1.0 sites were, in fact, pretty well-designed for the time and had quality content
on
them.</p></dd><dt>20. Is your HTML valid? Do you even check?</dt><dd>I do check occasionally, but don't go crazy over it.</dd><dt>21. What is your opinion on buttons and banners?</dt><dd>I love the idea behind them, but 88x31 size is just too small. We need a bigger standard.</dd><dt>22. What do you think of button walls in particular?</dt><dd>Not a fan. I prefer to write a short description of a site, as well as organize it in a grid or table. Just
dumping
a
bunch of eye bleeding buttons together just seems trashy and low effort.</dd><dt>23. If you started over again, would you make something similar or completely different?</dt><dd>Similar. I'm mostly satisfied with my site.</dd><dt>24. Are you envious of other people's websites?</dt><dd>Not at all lol. I might come off as immodest by saying this, but I genuinely believe that I'm a better coder
than
99% of
the indie web sphere and typical SEO slop sites.</dd><dt>25. What text editor do you use?</dt><dd>Visual Studio Code</dd><dt>26. Why do you use that one?</dt><dd>Because it's simple and it just works.</dd><dt>27. Do you host your image files on your web server, or on another host?</dt><dd>I host it on the same server.</dd><dt>28. This might not be relevant to you, but what's your opinion on the Neocities vs. Nekoweb debate?</dt><dd>Same shit really. I suppose the name "Neocities" is slightly less stupid than "Nekoweb".</dd><dt>29. How much server space would you estimate your main website takes up?</dt><dd>My whole /public/ folder, a.k.a. ready-to-upload website files that I generate with HUGO, along with all the
images,
is
26.6MB in total.</dd><dt>30. Do you keep local backups of your files?</dt><dd><s>Man, you know the situation with the indie web devs is dire when you need to ask such a question lol.</s></dd><dt>31. Do you prefer simple or highly visual websites?</dt><dd>I prefer design that enhances, or at least, doesn't get in the way of me enjoying the website's
content.</dd><dt>32. Do you stick to certain colors? Do you do that on purpose, or is it your subconscious?</dt><dd>No. At least, not intentionally. However, all of my websites are some variation of white, gray and black because
those
are neutral colors that work with everything.</dd><dt>33. Have you ever thought about quitting? Why?</dt><dd><p>No. Not at all. I have my comfy corner here away from all the noise <s>and idiots with custom Snoo
avatars</s>.
Why
would I
ever go back to normie social media? I guess I still use Reddit to engage with fandoms and hopefully drive
the
traffic
here, so hopefully more people discover the joy of making a personal website.</p></dd><dt id=34>34. Do you have many webmaster friends, or is it a solitary hobby?</dt><dd><p>Not yet, unfortunately. As you might have noticed, I am pretty argumentative and hold a lot of "unpopular"
opinions
regarding the state of the "Indie Web". I'm kind of a contrarian in general. I hate giving empty platitudes
and
I
criticize things because I <em>care</em>. I would love to make more <em>female</em> friends, someday,
hopefully.
I admit that
I
haven't really reached out to anyone yet either. Just lazy I suppose.</p></dd><dt>35. Do people in your real life know about your website?</dt><dd>Yeah. They like it.</dd><dt>36. Do you update your website very often? How often is "very often"?</dt><dd>Not too often. Maybe once a month at best, or once every few months.</dd><dt>37. And the overall design, do you change that much? Why or why not?</dt><dd>Not that often. Only when I have a very specific idea in mind, or my eye for good design improves.</dd><dt>38. Is your website more you-focused, hobby-focused, or outside world-focused?</dt><dd>Hobby-focused.</dd><dt>39. Do you do web design professionally?</dt><dd>Occasionally; usually as a one-off freelance side-gig.</dd><dt>40. If not, would you like to? And if you're comfortable answering, what do you do for work?</dt><dd>I prefer to keep my work life private.</dd><dt>41. Do you communicate with people by email very much?</dt><dd>Not too often, but I do like emails.</dd><dt>42. Some people reject social media and use websites as a replacement. Do you keep social media outside of your
website?</dt><dd>I still use Reddit. Mostly to just post my art and check other's art and then log off. I
occasionally browse
Tumblr anonymously with Tumlook for fanart, but I dislike the site overall. I do have a
guilty
pleasure
and that is Steam Discussion page. It's the closest thing on corporate web that still has
that
early 2000s forum
vibe, in part because the moderation is considerably more lax than on most social media sites. That's mostly
it.</dd><dt>43. How about instant messengers? Do you use a mainstream one like Discord or Telegram? Or something like
Matrix? Do you avoid them?</dt><dd>Discord for friends and Telegram for family and older people. Yes, I know,
it
is of the devil, but I couldn't be
bothered to switch.</dd><dt>44. Do you listen to music while you work on websites? If so, what kinds of artists?</dt><dd>Sometimes. Often though, I like to work in silence.</dd><dt>45. Do you keep everything you make on one website, or do you have more than one?</dt><dd>I have a separate website focused on cooking and recipes.</dd><dt>46. On a similar note, do you keep to one topic on your site, or many?</dt><dd>My art is mostly video game fan arts, with occasional shitposty OC content. As for blog, it's really anything I
feel
like writing at the time.</dd><dt>47. Do you present your real self, or at least try? Or do you construct a persona on purpose?</dt><dd>I share only as much as you need to know, when it's relevant to the topic at hand and no more than that.</dd><dt>48. Have you ever made a good friend thanks to your website?</dt><dd><p>No, I haven't yet. See <a href=#34>>>34</a></p></dd><dt>49. Are you happy with the way HTML and CSS currently work?</dt><dd><p>There are a few CSS features that I really want to use, such as <code>calc-size(auto)</code> for example,
that unfortunately are still not widely supported, but other than that, I'm content with the current state
of things for the most part.</p></dd><dt>50. What are practices that you think people should avoid?</dt><dd>Too much to list really.</dd><dt>51. What about underutilized practices, or things you think people should do more?</dt><dd>I think both this and the previous question would require a separate blogpost to fully answer.</dd><dt>52. Do you use a lot of semantic HTML? Or are you guilty of generic structure?</dt><dd>Yes! I love semantic HTML.</dd><dt>53. Do you consider different browsers?</dt><dd>I use Firefox primarily, but I do check my stuff on Edge (Chromium based).
I avoid using
features that don't
have
baseline
support.</dd><dt>54. Speaking of, what's your preferred browser? Convince your readers why they should use it.</dt><dd>Good ol' Firefox. Why should you use it? Well for starters, it's probably the only mainstream noncommercial
open-source
browser. You can also disable telemetry for good and install Ublock origin to watch YouTube without ads.</dd><dt>55. And what OS are you on?</dt><dd>Windows 11, for better or worse.</dd><dt>56. Do you have a strong opinion on that, or do you just happen to use it?</dt><dd>I have an X270 Thinkpad with Linux Mint installed on it. It's a good machine, but I use my PC for more than just
internet browsing, you know.</dd><dt>57. Are your websites mobile-friendly?</dt><dd>Yes.</dd><dt>58. What are your thoughts on autoplay?</dt><dd>If you do it, I hope your motherboard dies and your porn folder gets wiped. Delete your site and never do web
dev
again.</dd><dt>59. What are your thoughts on webrings? Are you in any?</dt><dd>Interesting in theory, most fail in practice. Most fan listings and webrings I've seen are either dead or
broken, or
they don't really have any curation and just accept whoever applies, leading to them being filled with low
quality
sites. Also, I think I prefer web directories. Maybe I'll start my own one day.</dd><dt>60. Do you have any web shrines? What do you like to see on that sort of page?</dt><dd>No. Not really my thing.</dd><dt>61. Are your websites "cliché", in your opinion?</dt><dd>I don't understand this question tbh.</dd><dt>62. What is your ideal website? Are you striving for that, or for something else?</dt><dd><p>A website that's focused on good quality content and with a design that's distinct yet elegant and not
overwhelming.
I
do try to improve my site when I feel that <em>it's time</em> and my skills have grown enough to fulfill my
new
vision.</p></dd><dt>63. Are you an artist? Do you draw or design your own assets?</dt><dd>I am, as you can see. But my website doesn't utilize a lot of graphical assets.</dd><dt>64. What are your favorite resource sites?</dt><dd>MDN and w3schools for checking documentation.</dd><dt>65. Is there a habit you just can't get away from no matter how hard you try?</dt><dd>Not really.</dd><dt>66. What's your biggest advice for a new webmaster?</dt><dd><p>Have something to say. Don't just make a worthless nostalgiashit website because it's trendy. Follow the
current
web
dev
best practices and don't use obsolete techniques. Don't copy and paste code that you do not understand. Less
is
more.
<strong>Remember to touch grass.</strong></p></dd><dt>67. Do you keep all your styling in CSS? Or do you hard-code some?</dt><dd>All my CSS is in an external stylesheet.</dd><dt>68. What do you think of frameset layouts?</dt><dd>Please don't.</dd><dt>69. How about table-based layouts?</dt><dd><p>This brings me back to my years of making a Tokyo Mew Mew fan site on narod.ru... Unless your goal is to
mimic an
actual
90s site, <em>don't</em>.</p></dd><dt>70. Do you subscribe to the ideas of "one-column", "two-column" and "three-column" layouts? Do you use any of
these?</dt><dd>I don't really think about layouts in that way to be honest. I guess I usually prefer single or two-column
layouts.</dd><dt>71. Do you spend longer on HTML or CSS?</dt><dd>CSS definitely.</dd><dt>72. Have you ever made a page with no CSS? It's useful for your thoughts.</dt><dd>No. I haven't really felt the need to.</dd><dt>73. Do you ever find yourself making layouts with nothing to put on them? Or do you only make layouts when the
need
arises?</dt><dd>I'm not really one to come up with elaborate layouts "naturally", so no.</dd><dt>74. Would you consider yourself a beginner? Or advanced? Somewhere in the middle?</dt><dd>I'd say advanced with HTML and CSS, but beginner with JavaScript (and Go for HUGO).</dd><dt>75. Do you have a habit of looking at the source code of websites you visit?</dt><dd>I sometimes use the "Inspect element" tool in Firefox, but other than that no, not really, unless I want to know
how
something is made.</dd><dt>76. How did <em>you</em> learn how to make websites?</dt><dd>Well, I watched some tutorials... But most importantly, I would actually try to create things that I had in mind
and
based on what I struggled with, I would do further research.</dd><dt>77. Do you ever force elements to do things they're not supposed to?</dt><dd>No, because it's bad for accessibility.</dd><dt>78. Thoughts on floating elements?</dt><dd>I don't use them and don't really have much to say.</dd><dt>79. When you're sizing stuff, what do you use first? Do you use px, em, %, or something else?</dt><dd>I use em and rem for most things, as well as % or vh or vw when I need them. I almost never use px.</dd><dt>80. Do you have a favorite font?</dt><dd>I would say Helvetica, but that joke stopped being funny in the 2000s. I do genuinely like it though. Other than
that, I mostly like sans-serif and monospace fonts, at least for the web.
I think they are easy to read. I hate Arial though.</dd><dt>81. Would you run a website with another person? How would that work?</dt><dd><em>No.</em></dd><dt>82. Do you surf the Web to find new personal websites very often?</dt><dd>Occasionally.</dd><dt>83. Do you bookmark other people's websites? How would you feel knowing someone else bookmarked yours?</dt><dd>Yes, I do bookmark sites that I like. I also meticulously organize my bookmarks and back them up every once in a
while.
I would be honored if someone bookmarked my site.</dd><dt>84. What do you want people to be most impressed with when they see your website?</dt><dd>I hope they like my art. I know most people don't care for quality of code, unless something doesn't work, but I
hope
that people like how clean and well organized my code is. I am always striving to improve with both my art and
coding
skills.</dd><dt>85. Are you interested in technology outside of websites? Do you collect?</dt><dd>I've chosen parts and built a PC for myself to work and game on.</dd><dt>86. How often and for how long are you online?</dt><dd>I spent a lot of time in front of my computer working and have Discord in the background, but I'm not in any of
the
large servers and I don't really "browse" the web all that much.</dd><dt>87. When it comes to your website, who is your target audience?</dt><dd>People who enjoy the same things I like, obviously.</dd><dt>88. Have you ever been interested in XHTML?</dt><dd>I haven't heard it mentioned in a while. No, not really.</dd><dt>89. Do you program in general? Have you ever written a program for use with or on your website, not counting
simple
JavaScript?</dt><dd>I wrote hello world in Python once. Jokes aside, no, I don't code aside from my website. I'd love to learn more
about GO
and JavaScript.</dd><dt>90. Speaking of programs that help you make websites, what do you think of static site generators (SSGs)? Have
you
ever used one?</dt><dd>I use Hugo and aside from a steep learning curve, I like it. I'd say one minor downside is that it's a bit
opinionated
and kinda forces you into a blog format by default, but you can "tame it", so to say. Nonetheless, I think any
SSG
is an
invaluable tool and you should absolutely learn one if you want to make something like an art website or a blog.</dd><dt>91. Do you keep a hitcounter? Why or why not?</dt><dd>No, because it's bloat.</dd><dt>92. Do you frequent forums? Which ones?</dt><dd>Yes and I prefer the forum format to social media. I mostly browse forums related to my interests.</dd><dt>93. Do you write your page content directly into the editor, or do you prepare it elsewhere, like a text
document
or

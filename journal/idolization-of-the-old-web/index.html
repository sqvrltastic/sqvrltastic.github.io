I'm saying this because people really need to stop idolizing the "old web" so much.</p><p><s>This might seem hypocritical, after all, isn’t my own website kinda oldish looking? Yes and no.</s> While I do like a lot of design trends from a bygone era and despise a lot of modern web development trends, I still do recognize that there are a lot of things that sucked about the web 1.0.</p><p>After all, I was born just in time during the turn of the millennia and while
I can't call myself "the OG internet user" (I am not a millennial, I am a very
old genZ), I still managed to catch a glimpse of the sunset of a static
personal website and PHP BB forum era.</p><p>I even developed my own websites
despite not even being double digits old yet. I remember using tables to
determine my website's layout and hand coding it all in Microsoft Frontpage 2003.</p><p>The point is, I was actually there, If only for a very brief time. Although,
since I didn't know English very well back then, I mostly stuck to the .ru
community. In particular, I used to really like browsing anime fan sites
hosted on narod.ru (narod.ru was a free hosting service that used to let its
users host a simple static personal webpage).</p><p>You would think that it was all garish, animated GIF backgrounds and horrible
inline CSS, basically barely usable amateurish 90s website stereotype, but no,
it wasn't. Well, sure, some websites were pretty ugly and by today's web
standards a lot of those websites do have issues with design, accessibility,
responsiveness and just general current best web development practices.</p><p>Still, they are nonetheless clearly made by someone who really tried to make
them as usable and as useful as possible. They clearly weren't "shitpost
websites" and no, I am not saying that every website has to be pretty and
"serve a purpose"... Heck do whatever you want, I don't care, but I am asking
you to consider the following...</p><p>My point is, people weren't making ugly and broken websites on purpose back
then. I bet most people really did try to make the best website they could
with the knowledge and technology they had at that time. The web technologies
have come a long way since the 90s and we have so much more tools, experience
and knowledge at our disposal.</p><p>Yes, overabundance of annoying ads sucks. Cookie banners suck. Unoptimized
JavaScript sucks. Tracking sucks. Soulless cookie-cutter flat design UI trend
sucks, yada yada yada. I'm not arguing against any of that.</p><p>However, we've
also learned how to make our websites more accessible to more people including
disabled users and we learned of the importance of making our website look
good on many different devices, so for example, people who can't afford a PC
can still access and have a good experience viewing our website on their
phone.</p><p>Some things in design just work, while others don't. 90% of websites have
black on white text because it works. Pastel-colored text with an elaborate
display font on an animated background doesn't work. It might look “cute”, but
it's not a good design because it makes interacting with the content harder
even for non-disabled people.</p><p>Thus, at least in my opinion, I'd rather have a
bland design that gets out of the way rather than an overly elaborate one that
makes my life harder.</p><p>The web revival revolution should not be a movement that's blindly stuck in
the past, forever bemoaning the "good old days" through rose-tinted glasses,
but one that sees the issues with the state of the current modern web, keeps
certain things from the past, but ultimately has its gaze turned towards the
<em>future</em> and is dedicated towards making the internet a better space with all
the knowledge we have accumulated thus far.</p><script type=application/ld+json>{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"sqvrltastic","url":"https://sqvrltastic.art/about-me/"}],"contentUrl":"https://sqvrltastic.art/journal/idolization-of-the-old-web/","datePublished":"2025-01-04T00:00:00Z","description":"Rambling about neoshitties, ugly websites, zoomers who idolize them and web accessibility.","headline":"Neocities and the (misguided) idolization of the old web","name":"Neocities and the (misguided) idolization of the old web"}</script></main></div><div id=right-column><ul id=social-media><li><a href=https://www.reddit.com/user/sqvrltastic/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src=/assets/images/icons/reddit.png alt=Reddit class=icon></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/sqvrltastic target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src=/assets/images/icons/github.png alt=Github class=icon></a></li><li><a href=/rss.xml target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src=/assets/images/icons/rss.png alt=RSS class=icon></a></li><li><a href=mailto:sqvrltastic@gmail.com><img src=/assets/images/icons/email.png alt=Email class=icon></a></li></ul><button id=theme-toggle aria-label="toggle theme">

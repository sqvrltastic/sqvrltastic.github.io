While in theory, <strong>"Creativity™ 🎨✨"</strong> is "good", it has nonetheless led to the platform getting flooded with subjectively low quality, objectively extremely poorly optimized websites with stupidly large, bloated, uncompressed assets. I'm looking at you, <em>artists</em> in particular. Please stop uploading your whole ass artworks as uncompressed 19MB PNGs and then dumping them all on one page for fuck's sake. Not to mention that some people blatantly break Neocities ToS and just treat it as a free file hosting service... Please stop doing that, use something like Catbox instead...</p><blockquote><p>But it's hurr durr free! Muh self-expression muh creativity! LET PEOPLE HAVE FUN GODDAMIT! <i>😡</i></p></blockquote><p>Are you stupid? Do you realize that nothing is truly free? Somebody is paying for your "free" <s>lunch</s> web hosting. The 1GB free limit is very generous, but I think it encourages using Neocities as a file dump. I assure you, you can get away with something like, 200MB, or 500MB of disk space and it would be plenty. BTW... And this is totally a 100% humblebrag but, <em>my whole website</em>, with all assets, fonts, images, pages, everything; 300+ files in total — weighs just about 30MB at the time of writing this.</p><p>And it's really not that hard to keep your site optimized! Biggest thing for most people is definitely image optimization — use appropriately-sized images and use modern image formats with good compression, such as <strong>AVIF</strong>, or at least <strong>JPEG</strong>. Also, if you use custom fonts (like me! I love good typography), remember to <strong>subset</strong> them and use modern <strong>WOFF2</strong> format that is optimized for web.</p><blockquote><p>So what are you suggesting we do, sqvrltastic? Should we just kick every unoptimized, blinkie-overloaded amateur website off Neocities?!</p></blockquote><p>I am not suggesting anything. I am merely suggesting that you should treat <em>free</em> web hosting not as an invitation to "do whatever you want <em>kween</em> fuck social media amirite 🤪", but to approach it with more care and consideration. A free platform cannot exist, or it will be destined to introduce more aggressive monetization, if people keep flooding it with bloated, low quality content. I think you should either self-host, or pay for hosting if you don't care about being prudent about your file size weight.</p><script type=application/ld+json>{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"sqvrltastic","url":"https://sqvrltastic.art/about-me/"}],"contentUrl":"https://sqvrltastic.art/journal/free-web-hosting-services-are-not-free/","datePublished":"2026-01-29T00:00:00Z","description":"Lately I've been witnessing how Neocities is slowly falling apart, with Kyle only occasionally chiming in to solve only the most egregious and pressing technical issues and I have some thoughts on the matter...","headline":"\"Free\" web hosting services are not free","name":"\"Free\" web hosting services are not free"}</script></main></div><div id=right-column><ul id=social-media><li><a href=https://www.reddit.com/user/sqvrltastic/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src=/assets/images/icons/reddit.png alt=Reddit class=icon></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/sqvrltastic target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src=/assets/images/icons/github.png alt=Github class=icon></a></li><li><a href=/rss.xml target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src=/assets/images/icons/rss.png alt=RSS class=icon></a></li><li><a href=mailto:sqvrltastic@gmail.com><img src=/assets/images/icons/email.png alt=Email class=icon></a></li></ul><button id=theme-toggle aria-label="toggle theme">
